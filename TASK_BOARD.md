# Takolio Culinary Visual & Closed-Loop Kitchen Experience Checkpoint - 2026-10-20

Status: `CULINARY_VISUAL_LOOP_BRANCH_VERIFIED`.
Branch: `feat/takolio-culinary-experience` (implementation commit `c0831c9ef18d2caaa733f93d3ca09db2338e9d64`; `main` remains untouched at `96c4236e572a94df4977a686e20e31312191a321`).

- Added `src/web/lib/culinary-visuals.ts` and `src/web/components/cooking/CookingTechniqueVisual.tsx` for 8-technique Vietnamese culinary classification, inline SVG illustrations, dish placeholders, and `KitchenLoopStrip` closed-loop navigation.
- Upgraded `RecipeCard.tsx`, `RecipeMedia.tsx`, `HomePage.tsx`, `RecipesPage.tsx`, `RecipeDetailPage.tsx`, `CookingModePage.tsx`, `CookingReview.tsx`, `CookingCompletePage.tsx`, and kitchen stylesheets (`kitchen-foundation.css`, `kitchen-recipes.css`, `kitchen-cooking.css`).
- Added `tests/unit/ui15-culinary-upgrade.test.tsx` and `tests/e2e/t17-ui/takolio-culinary-experience.e2e.ts`.
- Verified: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `node scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, Vitest `32/32` files (`414/414` tests) PASS, Playwright `12/12` across 6 viewports PASS, and `scripts/takolio-upgrade-check.mjs` `24/24` stress checks PASS.
- Next: review `feat/takolio-culinary-experience` and open PR when ready; `main` was not modified.

# Latest production request checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `PRODUCTION_NOT_DEPLOYED_STAGING_CERTIFICATE_MISSING`.
Release source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; main and Admin CI PASS.
This current checkpoint supersedes the historical checkpoints retained below.

Production run `39333366228` is plan-only: plan SUCCESS, execute SKIPPED.
No production Admin mutation or new execute dispatch was performed. The
`admin-production` Environment has its release credentials but no
`ADMIN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION` or current run-bound release authorization.
The adapter requires a signed exact-source ST01-ST20 all-PASS certificate for
all production operations except emergency disable. Current evidence is
unsigned and incomplete: 6 PASS, 6 PARTIAL, 8 PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.
The missing separate Access test identity remains an external prerequisite;
the owner's existing deploy and Environment-approval authorization is retained.

Read-only recheck: main SHA, CI/run job states, Environment protection rules,
secret names and artifact metadata verified. The production Admin hostname
was not resolvable from this machine; customer web/API health returned HTTP
200. This hostname observation is not a substitute for a Cloudflare inventory.
The latest owner staging session was logged out; a subsequent `/me` navigation
returned the Cloudflare Access sign-in page. The previous Mac-lock/logout
uncertainty is resolved. Screenshot: ignored local
`.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/logout-confirmed-20261020.png`.

Checks: `git diff --check` and `python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` PASS.
No source, gate, protection, customer database, payment, OTP or AI API change.
Next: complete actual missing staging evidence, package/sign the protected
exact-source certificate, then perform protected production commissioning.
A gate change would need an explicit reviewed release-policy change; this
request did not fabricate PASS or silently remove the certificate gate.

# Current Admin staging checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_OWNER_SMOKE_ROLLBACK_PASS_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`.
Exact source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; exact-main CI
`39289222795` and Admin CI `39289223049` remain PASS. No runtime, customer,
payment, OTP or AI-provider code changed in this continuation.

Fresh protected staging evidence remains PASS: emergency disable
`39331453601`, paired rollback `39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066`, all
approved by `vn-taphoanhatung` with run-bound signatures and verified artifacts.
Owner SSO smoke resumed on the exact source and a logout event was verified.
A later login was opened for more GET coverage; macOS locked during logout, so
the latest session logout remains UNCONFIRMED. See latest browser limitation.

Additional read-only evidence under ignored `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/`:

- `api-read-scan-0307fc10.json`: six owner-authenticated GET payloads (`me`,
  users, overview, settings, audit, sessions) scanned; no forbidden credential
  field names found. The session-bound CSRF field is expected. This is payload
  evidence only and does not close every ST13 path.
- `boundary-extended-valid-preflight.json`: 60 anonymous/forged-header edge
  checks PASS. GET/POST redirect to the exact Access tenant; valid hostile-origin
  OPTIONS preflight returns the exact Cloudflare 403 denial body with no CORS
  headers. These are edge checks, not authenticated Worker CSRF/RBAC evidence.
  The original malformed OPTIONS probe omitted Access-Control-Request-Method,
  returned HTTP 400 and remains a retained failed harness. Its intermediate
  status-only reinterpretation is superseded and not acceptance evidence.
- `owner-final-logout-recheck.png`: an earlier verified logout at `/admin/login`;
  a subsequent session logout is unconfirmed because macOS locked.

Focused validation: release/provider/auth/concurrency tests `213/213` PASS;
T21RC2 capture files `93/93` PASS with `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`; Admin build and
both TypeScript checks PASS. Lint exits 0 with two warnings in generated ignored
bundles. Public scan and diff check PASS. An inadvertently unscoped full-suite
run reported 11 failures in two macOS temp-path/identity-fixture tooling files
(9105 tests passed); all 93 tests in those files passed on the focused corrected
temp-directory run. The failed full run is not reported as all-suite PASS.

The exact staging certification gate still has only 6 PASS (ST01/ST02/ST11/ST14/
ST17/ST20), 6 PARTIAL (ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19), and 8
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE` (ST03-ST07/ST09/ST12/ST15). Missing evidence includes
validly signed foreign/expired JWTs at the live Worker, an actual separate Access
identity and role matrix, authenticated negative CSRF, internal facade negatives,
concurrency/key recovery, complete audit/action matrix, real-host axe/load/JWKS
and full customer regression. No all-PASS report or certificate was signed.

Production plan-only run `39333366228` remains SUCCESS with execute SKIPPED,
artifact `12224599448` (archive SHA256
`0a75a03d8db02fcaf22a6363eb783360bee0e63e483789efbbe87c60f2d76713`).
`productionMutationExecuted=false`; production Admin remains untouched.
Next: complete the missing real staging evidence, package the protected exact-SHA
certificate, then perform the signed production commissioning sequence. Existing
owner authorization for deployment and Environment approvals remains valid;
this blocker is evidence, not a new permission request.

## Latest browser limitation

After the successful logout screenshot below, the owner session was opened once
more to continue the remaining GET coverage. The Mac then locked during the
logout attempt. The new session's logout is UNCONFIRMED; the earlier screenshot
proves its own completed logout event only, not the final current session state.
Do not reuse that image as proof that the latest session is logged out. No
browser lock bypass was attempted. Native Chrome access must resume on an
unlocked Mac for further authenticated acceptance work.

# Current Admin staging checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_OWNER_SMOKE_ROLLBACK_PASS_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`.
Exact source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; protected main and
exact-main CI `39289222795` / Admin CI `39289223049` remain unchanged and PASS.
This header supersedes the historical checkpoints retained below.

Owner Access login, dashboard/users/AI/recipes/system/audit/settings reads,
preference save, `/me`, logout and post-logout `/me` rejection completed on this
source. Authenticated users JSON contained 21 rows and no forbidden credential
fields; this is one payload path, not full ST13 certification. Credentials and
private data remain outside Git.

Fresh protected staging emergency disable `39331453601`, paired rollback
`39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066` all PASS with run-bound owner
signatures, actual `vn-taphoanhatung` Environment approvals and verified artifact
digests. Full source-specific ST20 now PASS. Current enabled Admin version:
`e7ed80bd-26cb-4e33-a658-0cf298412af0`; facade:
`4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`. Disabled baseline Admin:
`e38bfb72-8614-4b9f-b3e3-ef3fdf0824eb`, same facade. Anonymous boundary curl
checks PASS 12/12; customer `takolio.app` and `api.takolio.app` health 200/ok.

Current required matrix: 6 PASS (ST01/ST02/ST11/ST14/ST17/ST20), 6 PARTIAL
(ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19), 8 `PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`
(ST03-ST07/ST09/ST12/ST15). Missing actual foreign/expired token, other identity/
role, negative CSRF/facade, concurrency/recovery, full API exclusion, real-host
axe/load/JWKS and full customer regression evidence still prevents certification.
No all-PASS report or certificate was signed. Production plan-only `39333366228`
PASS with execute SKIPPED; no production Admin mutation/deployment occurred.

The Chrome extension still lacks its automation connection; native Chrome was
used through the documented UI API. Initial owner continuation failed under a
stale Access session; ordinary Cloudflare SSO sign-in restored it without OTP.
Initial Python urllib probes returned Cloudflare browser-integrity error 1010;
that failed harness report remains separate from successful curl boundary and
health evidence. An incorrect early `/api/health` path and Access-protected
customer staging health were not treated as runtime outage or successful health.
Preserve earlier release FAIL/UNKNOWN receipts and the checkpoint stash.

Latest ignored evidence: `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/`.
`git diff --check` and `python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` PASS. Only operational
documentation changed; no runtime code, customer data/schema, payment, OTP or AI
provider change was performed. Next: complete remaining live evidence, then the
protected exact-source staging certificate and production sequence. The owner
already delegated Environment approvals; no renewed deployment permission is
needed for the authorized scope.

# Current Admin staging release status - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_ENABLED_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED_LIVE_EVIDENCE`.
Exact source `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa` is merged through PR #22;
exact-main CI `39289222795` and Admin CI `39289223049` both PASS.
Fresh protected staging rollback `39292571221`, deploy-disabled `39293405049`,
and enable `39294320059` all PASS. Authorization, pre-action and receipt digests
were independently matched to the actual successful run and reviewer approval.

The verified disabled baseline at this SHA is Admin
`e38bfb72-8614-4b9f-b3e3-ef3fdf0824eb` / facade
`4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`. Current enabled staging Admin version is
`22c714f5-b281-4f9c-8a90-78292df78db4` with that same facade. Post-enable
anonymous Access denial checks PASS 12/12; customer health is HTTP 200/status=ok.

Production Admin has not been deployed or mutated. The corrected rollback
component passed, but a full emergency-OFF/paired-rollback cycle on this exact
new source has not run; do not mark complete ST20 or the entire ST01-ST20 matrix
PASS. Actual new-source owner dashboard/API/logout smoke was interrupted by
macOS locking; Chrome extension authentication was also unavailable. The user
confirmed no separate actual test Access identity. Foreign-token, unauthorized/
unprivileged identity, other-role, CSRF, facade-negative, recovery, full audit,
axe/load/JWKS and complete customer regression evidence remains pending/partial.
No all-PASS staging report or certificate was signed. The removed staffing quorum
is not reintroduced. No OTP or paid AI call was made.

The user delegated Environment approvals through the existing reviewer Chrome
session. Those approvals were used successfully; main review protections and
Environment settings remain intact. A run dispatched early (`39290770177`)
failed at authorization before Cloudflare execution because its runner started
before the new run-bound secret was stored. Preserve that FAIL and all earlier
FAIL/UNKNOWN rollback receipts. The original outage checkpoint stash is retained.

Next: unlock Mac/resume real owner smoke and finish missing actual live evidence,
rehearse exact-source OFF/rollback, then sign/protect the completed staging
certificate before the production sequence. Details and exact artifact digests:
`docs/admin/production-readiness/30_STAGING_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_20261020.md`.
Ignored local evidence: `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020`.

This current header supersedes historical statuses and PASS wording below.

# Admin staging live acceptance / rollback fix - 2026-10-20 JST

Runtime main 24cf5d45 has completed staging restore, four Admin migrations, HMAC,
actual owner enrollment/bootstrap, disabled baseline and enable (39270091042
PASS). Real Chrome owner reads and logout were verified. Emergency OFF
39273582548 PASS. Paired rollback 39274064739 and instrumented 39275962070 FAIL /
UNKNOWN: /settings kept reporting latest-upload shutdown bindings while the
reviewed disabled version was receiving 100% traffic. Compensation is observed;
latest GET-only probe sees Admin 4f105c43 and facade f8c39deb, console OFF.
No production Admin operation has run; customer/payments were not mutated.

Candidate codex/admin-active-version-bindings-20261020 verifies serving-version
bindings through deployment/version/deployment reads, rejects split or changed
deployments and duplicate binding names, and uses that selection in receipts.
Focused release/provider/CLI suite 4 files / 215 tests PASS; lint PASS (two existing
generated warnings), both typechecks and Admin build PASS; candidate GET-only
live metadata probe PASS (9 reads, no mutations). Earlier initial test fixture
setup error was corrected; final assertions were retained. Full ST01-ST20 stays
incomplete (ST20 FAIL; negative identity/role/CSRF/facade, recovery, axe/load and
JWKS evidence missing). No staging certificate or production readiness claim.

Next: independent exact-HEAD PR approval and hosted checks, normal merge and
exact-main CI, fresh protected rollback-disabled rehearsal, then new disabled
baseline/enable and complete actual live evidence before production.
Details: docs/admin/production-readiness/30_STAGING_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_20261020.md.

# Admin commissioning publication - 2026-10-18

PR #16: https://github.com/hello-tako/Takolio/pull/16, branch
codex/admin-infrastructure-commissioning-20261018. Initial implementation commit
37bcf42554ed4fd31e290dc1674b0a8321e3824c; required PR checks are running and
reviewDecision=REVIEW_REQUIRED. Final PR HEAD needs its own checks and review;
main 8217f0bd evidence does not certify these commissioning changes.

Executed on the commissioning candidate: pnpm lint PASS; focused credential
workflow/infrastructure/release/config suite 4 files / 92 tests PASS;
admin-public-scan PASS; git diff --check PASS; offline release preflight
configurationValidation=PASS with readyForDeployment=false/remoteExecuted=false.
Earlier local full-run 5-second timeout and subsequent 32/32 rerun remain
attributed in 21_INFRASTRUCTURE_COMMISSIONING.md; hosted exact-main full suites
both passed 9,043 tests. No live evidence status was promoted by those results.

Next: owner creates/enters the scoped credentials through the protected UI,
then exact-HEAD review/CI, merge and exact-main checks, protected credential audit,
real owner key/identity enrollment and the fixed staging release sequence.
The current browser token draft has name/account/Workers Scripts Edit only and
an empty next permission row; no credential was generated. The requested exact
permissions and secret names are in 22_CREDENTIAL_HANDOFF.md. Current runtime
and release policy are still disabled; Admin has not been deployed.

# Admin infrastructure commissioning - 2026-10-18

PR #15 approved at 89349b4c and merged through protection as 8217f0bd.
Exact-main Admin CI 39121353870 and CI 39121353814 both PASS with 405 files /
9,043 tests each; Admin workerd 10/10, migration 25/25, browser 12/12 and
keyboard 10/10 PASS. Main artifact 12134718940 is correctly bound to 8217f0bd;
the preflight is offline-only and reports an untracked Python cache.

Provisioned separate staging/production Admin D1/KV and Access apps, plus
protected admin-staging/admin-production Environments. Both Access apps use the
current Cloudflare owner email, Allow only, 30-minute sessions, and no bypass.
Staging and production HttpOnly/binding cookies are ON; production settings were
read back after Save. Sole-owner private identity stays outside public Git.

Exact-main GET-only audit 39122015225 SUCCESS observed both Admin D1/KV pairs and
customer bindings; readyForDeployment=false. Access organization remains HTTP
403 and filtered app inventory is empty under the old audit credential, so the
credential visibility discrepancy remains PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.

Commissioning policy records all observed nonsecret targets but stays
enabled=false with no rostered signing key. New admin-credential-audit.yml is a
GET-only manual workflow limited to protected Admin Environments and dedicated
Admin secrets, with no fallback to customer credentials. New focused contract
and configuration suite: 4 files / 92 tests PASS. See production-readiness/21
and 22 for identities, evidence attribution and exact credential handoff.

No Admin Worker upload, migration, secret, owner enrollment/bootstrap or console
enable occurred. Scoped credentials, actual verified Access subject, owner-held
Ed25519 key/backup, live staging ST01-ST20 and production release remain
PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. The browser credential final step requires owner
handoff; the draft has only name/account/Workers Scripts Edit prepared.
Customer/payment runtime and customer Environments remain unchanged.

# Production build guard correction - 2026-10-18

Current: DOMAIN_STAGING_VERIFIED on d5f2e726; production cutover pending the reviewed
adapter correction. This checkpoint supersedes earlier domain status sections.
Production remains version 01b81140/source 526596a8. Admin remains reserved.

Staging canonical release 39098613336 succeeded with version 53b3ce38 and both
custom hostnames. Real Google GIS, approved-inbox OTP delivery, refresh/logout,
sandbox QR/provider verification and signed synthetic replay, user journeys and
mobile/PWA smoke were executed. The sandbox event was not a bank settlement or
transfer. Staging scan used its configured mock-AI pipeline. A real paired rollback
restored 5ce93d26, retained the app hostname, detached only the receipt-owned API
hostname and passed audit 39098518311 before canonical same-SHA re-release.
Public evidence with explicit test scope:
https://github.com/hello-tako/Takolio/pull/13#issuecomment-6245968702

The old staging checksum appeared in private tool output. The owner confirmed
rotation and Worker secret update. No new checksum was read. Two real provider
verification callbacks after rotation returned POST 200/outcome ok/exceptions 0;
the canonical webhook was restored. Audit 39101311454 confirms the same active
version/source, isolated bindings, vars, secret names, runtime and operations.
The owner-approved exact-path Access exception retains Worker signatures;
anonymous app/health remain protected.

Read-only production certification 39101415582 was independently approved and
passed at 05:44:39Z. Production release 39101591421 was independently approved by
vn-taphoanhatung, then failed at prepared before upload/traffic/hostname mutation.
Receipt records mutationAttempted=false, no uploadedVersionId and recovery says
no traffic or hostname mutation attempted. Failed evidence remains unchanged.

The actual production build passes. Exact receipt reproduction identifies the
composition CLI's optional config argument as staging-only. The adapter now uses
existing generic composition/planner validators directly against audited production
vars and the compiled UI record, with an explicit production identity check.
Mismatches still fail. Staging, shared validators, customer application, payments,
schema, feature flags and workflow protections are unchanged.

Executed: actual pnpm build and corrected adapter build using the sanitized
production receipt PASS; 19 related files / 288 tests PASS (11 new build cases);
lint, both TypeScript checks and customer/Admin migration smoke PASS. Two existing
generated-bundle lint warnings and existing Admin font warnings remain. Exact-head
hosted CI and independent PR review remain mandatory; full hosted result pending.

Next: protected fix review/merge and exact-main CI, new canonical staging receipt
and accurate acceptance on the new SHA, fresh production certification and release
approval, then at least 15 real minutes and final live acceptance. Do not relabel
an old-SHA attestation as a test of the new release. See 24-production-build-guard.md.

---

# Final local verification - 2026-10-17

Full canonical-temp run: 388 files / 8,804 tests PASS. Final focused audit/config/
readiness/Admin guard run: 44/44 PASS; independent read-only delta review PASS.
Lint, both TypeScript checks and public-change scan PASS. The full run overlapped
final audit fixes; final focused checks and exact-commit hosted CI cover that
delta. Prior build/migration smoke also passed. No new application/domain deploy
has occurred. Fresh final-head GitHub review and CI remain mandatory. See
`docs/domain-integration/14-release-operations.md`.

---

# Credential and release checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED`; new-domain staging acceptance and
production cutover remain pending. The owner authorized production release and
confirmed creating/saving the reviewed separate Cloudflare tokens. Both 30-day
API tokens and account-ID secrets are now saved in their matching GitHub
Environments; expiry is 2026-11-16. Separate release-verification keys are also
synchronized with the Workers and proven by authenticated HTTP 200 responses.
Secret rotation preserved code/runtime/bindings/assets. Current production
version is `01b81140-3162-47e0-8573-88b679877f8a` (source `526596a8`); staging is
`b4257b5c-dddf-4093-b969-f5bc09888bf6` (source `f7386e6a`). This was credential
provisioning, not a new application/domain deployment. Admin is undeployed.

The post-main-merge CI failure was isolated to the Admin customer-baseline test
(8,794 other tests passed); its reviewed-baseline guard and the public documentation
scan are fixed. Generated production candidates now explicitly preserve
workers.dev/preview OFF. A manual current-schema read-only Cloudflare audit is
prepared; the historical 0039-only readiness contract remains intact. Final-head
hosted CI and fresh PR #3 approval are required; prior approval was dismissed by
GitHub after the main merge. Main and Environment protections remain enforced.

Next: finish final-head CI/review, merge normally, pass exact-main CI and execute
read-only infrastructure audits. Resolve operational/provider/isolation evidence
before reviewing a deployment activation path; the default Deploy workflow still
uses legacy configs. Do not dispatch it as a domain cutover. Live staging must
pass before production Environment approval and rollout. See
`docs/domain-integration/14-release-operations.md` for evidence and exact gates.

# Release operations checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Canonical repository: `hello-tako/Takolio` (`1422954151`). Admin prerequisite PR #2
was approved by `vn-taphoanhatung` at exact head `84554b0f` and merged through
branch protection as `304349ea09d542881eb09033327fdd0ff8c2d272`.
This does not activate or deploy the Admin Console. Domain PR #3 was approved at
`352a4211`; it is being integrated with the new main and requires fresh exact-head
CI and review. Its last complete hosted run was 39011736920: 368 files / 8499 tests
passed, plus lint, type checks, migration validation and production build.
Local isolated browser regression: 94/94 passed (synthetic providers).

The owner authorized production release and creating necessary Cloudflare tokens.
GitHub staging/production Environments and account-ID secrets are restored;
production still requires independent environment review without admin bypass.
Cloudflare tokens are being provisioned with limited scope and 30-day expiry.
New-domain live staging/provider acceptance remains pending; production/DNS are
unchanged. Keep the existing planner/T20 flags and isolated storage. Never infer
staging or production verification from local tests or candidate dry runs.

# Current checkpoint: Takolio domain integration - 2026-10-17

Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED`; staging blocked; production NOT_CHANGED. This checkpoint supersedes historical operational claims below for the current domain task.

Canonical source: `hello-tako/Takolio`, repository ID `1422954151`; base `526596a8cd857984ad2b69901a8c7b0e9d6bccc2`; branch `feat/takolio-app-domain-integration`. Both combined Workers are preserved, Admin remains reserved. Default Wrangler files, payment business logic and storage schema are unchanged. New routing is dormant until an explicitly reviewed generated candidate enables it.

Implemented: central domain profiles, exact host boundaries, safe WWW document redirects, preserved legacy app/API, API-only aliases, noindex/SEO, verified native association 404 boundaries, current-host export attribution, local read-only capture/probes and candidate preparation. Candidate preparation checks complete supported typed bindings, compatibility, staging overlap and clean source identity, and reports outstanding operational audit blockers. Unknown binding shapes are rejected.

Actual local verification: full run before final review fixes 367 files / 8,496 tests PASS (811.53s). After review fixes, 86 focused domain/config/CORS/Workerd tests PASS; domain + export presentation subset 38 PASS. Lint, both TypeScript checks, paired planner/T20 build, migration smoke and high-severity dependency audit PASS. Initial synthetic harness failures (stale validator, Hono HSTS ordering) were corrected; actual Workerd harness initially omitted has_user_worker and was corrected without relaxing assertions. Legacy HSTS regression assertion required the outer header to preserve existing strict legacy asset policy. No tests were skipped or timeouts increased.

Browser: isolated synthetic SQLite preview, mobile 390x844 and desktop 1440x1000. Created 7-day family meal plan, opened shopping view, refreshed nested route, no horizontal overflow or broken images on inspected views. This is local regression evidence, not live domain or real Google/OTP/PayOS certification. Plain Vite static preview initially showed session-unavailable because no API was attached; switched to existing isolated API preview.

Cloudflare: account `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`, active zone `takolio.app` / `9284fb2186987f14f810818583acaa46`, Universal SSL active. DNS 0 records, Worker routes 0, Redirect rules 0, no Worker connected. Access has 3 unrelated apps and no Takolio staging protection. Edge HSTS, live cron/consumers/observability and account-wide DO/Workflows remain unverified. Pages/D1 list NOT_ACCESSIBLE with current OAuth. Existing staging storage/queue IDs are distinct, but sandbox provider credentials/data sensitivity are unverified.

Live versions: production `35dd189e-7e3c-4782-b69b-237da7dadd62`, SHA equals verified main; staging `b97b11fe-9151-41ac-9130-52532c045c8e`, SHA `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1` exists and is ancestor of main. Read-only probes reached legacy production/staging; all five new hosts unreachable. No DNS, Worker, database, secret, OAuth, email or payment mutation occurred.

Next: final exact-head draft PR/hosted CI and independent review; then authorized operator resolves Cloudflare scope, live settings, staging Access/data/provider isolation, Google JS origins and approved OTP inbox. New-domain staging acceptance must precede any separate owner production approval. Current repository has 0 Actions secrets and 0 Environments; historical deployment identity/approval controls need reviewed restoration before release. Do not weaken branch protection or route Admin.

# Admin R2 local recovery/readiness checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Status: ADMIN_V1_PRODUCTION_READINESS_BLOCKED. Runtime source:
066c35ad670bc877756150c2055e3844dd7a17ce, branch
codex/admin-v1-r2-production-readiness, Draft PR #82 (last verified remote backend
ba762a205fd890efe4af47ef6c0fd7cd6f45fc14). PR #77 remains untouched.

Recovered facade/identity/governance/recovery implementation and fixed independently
reproduced roster/target races. Added CI-safe synthetic fixture guard while real
operator provisioning still refuses CI. On the exact clean runtime commit with
Node24/pnpm10/Python3.12, canonical TMPDIR and CI=true/GITHUB_ACTIONS=true:
382 files /8661 tests, 146 focused tests, lint, typecheck, build, customer/Admin
migration smoke, 9 workerd scenarios/127 assertions, 23 migration cases,
12 Admin browser tests and 10 consecutive keyboard repetitions all PASS.
Tracked screenshot diff, configuration preflight, public patch scan and dependency
audit exit0. Full suite completed 2026-10-16T20:59:30Z; source unchanged.
Independent reviewer /root/independent_admin_review found no new actionable issue
in final delta; review scope and inherited SHA-specific evidence are explicit.
Earlier failed and interrupted runs are retained, never promoted to PASS.

Complete 19-document evidence package: docs/admin/production-readiness/00-18.
Customer runtime, customer migrations and customer release protected paths are
unchanged from main 526596a8cd857984ad2b69901a8c7b0e9d6bccc2. No customer payment,
authentication or production infrastructure operation occurred.

Blocked: GitHub account suspended prevents ref refresh/push/hosted CI; four
release workflows remain offline plans with no reviewed live adapters; protections,
real Access/resource identity, independent human roster/custody, representative
D1 load and all live staging/rollback gates are unverified. Staging authorization
is required; production is not deployed or authorized. Next: restore GitHub,
publish local branch/evidence with a normal push, commission live-adapter/protection
review and scoped staging authorization. No merge, remote D1, secrets change,
production bootstrap, deployment or enablement is authorized.

# PR #77 brand-main merge verification — 2026-10-16

**Result:** four conflicts resolved in merge
`03a84b03e0b11b93c0e2ab2a6c56cc29cf3fa845` (parents `73e0c490`, `526596a8`).
On that exact source: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`,
`pnpm check:migrations` and focused Admin/brand Vitest all exit0. Regression
command: `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/admin- tests/integration/admin-
tests/unit/takolio-brand.test.mjs tests/unit/takolio-3d-assets.test.mjs
tests/unit/takolio-mascot.test.tsx --maxWorkers=1 --silent`: 13 files /143 tests
PASS. Both customer/Admin migration smoke markers are `ok`. Existing Admin font
build warnings remain; the expected emitted font files are present.

Both complete parent status histories survive. Main's Takolio and V3 brand
commands and all prior Admin commands/build/migration checks coexist in valid
package JSON, with dependencies and lockfile unchanged. Customer runtime/assets,
configs/migrations and incoming brand artifacts match merged main byte-for-byte;
Admin runtime/config/schema matches the previous PR head. Resolution-path diff
checks and conflict-marker scans pass. Broad merge diff whitespace warnings are
inherited verbatim font licenses / historical logs, not new resolution changes;
those authoritative files were not reformatted. Separate local R2 stays excluded.

**Next:** publish only this handoff merge/receipt and require exact-head hosted CI.
Full repository tests and browser E2E were not rerun locally for this conflict
resolution. Preserve draft / DO NOT MERGE status, F1–F11 and independent-review /
release gates. No PR merge/close, deploy, remote D1, secret or account operation.

# PR #77 brand-main conflict reconciliation — 2026-10-16

**Scope:** merge main `526596a8cd857984ad2b69901a8c7b0e9d6bccc2` into handoff `73e0c490a15e2014abb6e5096ec45ec980981d37`.
Resolved three docs/ai status conflicts by keeping both complete parent histories.
Resolved package.json by retaining main's `brand:icons` Takolio generator and
`brand:icons:v3` legacy generator alongside all handoff Admin commands and the
existing Admin-aware build/migration checks. No dependency/lockfile change.
All customer source/assets/configs/migrations and incoming brand evidence are
identical to main; no custom product, authentication, payment or release edit.
Separate local R2 commits remain excluded from this historical handoff PR.

**Checks:** both-parent status content retention, package JSON/script assertions,
no conflict markers/unmerged paths, customer/main byte identity and diff check.
Lint/types/build/migration/Admin regression results follow in the verification
checkpoint. This merge does not remediate F1–F11 or grant release certification.

**Next:** publish the conflict-only handoff update and require exact-head hosted
CI. Preserve draft / DO NOT MERGE, independent review and release gates; no PR
merge/close, deployment, remote D1, credential or account operation is authorized.

# PR #77 conflict-resolution verification — 2026-10-16

**Result:** all three status-document conflicts resolved in merge
`d47cc70b0d477dfbf575e3d215f71178231a1362` (parents `87d6d3d`, `f7386e6a`).
On that exact source: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`,
`pnpm check:migrations` and `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/admin-
tests/integration/admin- --maxWorkers=1 --silent` all exit0; Admin regressions:
10 files / 133 tests PASS. Both migration smoke markers are `ok`. Build reports
the existing runtime-resolved Admin font warnings; the generated font files exist.
Conflict-marker scan, staged diff check, both parents' status-history retention,
and exact customer-source/config/migration identity against merged main PASS.
The merge changes no Admin runtime/config/schema from the published handoff.

**Publication boundary:** only this handoff main merge and its verification notes
are authorized for PR #77. Separate local R2 commits/artifacts are excluded.
Full repository tests and browser E2E were not rerun locally for these document
resolutions; exact-head hosted CI remains required. Draft / DO NOT MERGE,
Admin findings, independent review and release gates remain unchanged.
No PR merge/close, deployment, remote D1, secret or account change.

# PR #77 main-conflict reconciliation — 2026-10-16

**Scope:** merge current main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1` into handoff
`87d6d3d2acc69a6ca3f0409c3c22753469807222` without rebasing or publishing local R2 work.
Resolved conflicts in `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` and
`docs/ai/TASK_BOARD.md` by retaining both the Admin handoff notice and all new
main-side status entries. Customer runtime, configs, migration history and main's
T26/T27 changes are taken unchanged from the merged main. No new product/UI,
authentication, payment, deployment or remote database change is introduced.

**Checks:** conflict-marker scan, main/head status-document content retention,
customer-source identity against merged main, and staged diff validation.
Additional lint/types/migration/admin regression results are recorded in the
follow-up verification checkpoint. This merge does not resolve Admin F1–F11 or
certify staging/production. The separate local R2 branch is not part of this PR.

**Next:** publish only this handoff merge, require exact-head CI, retain draft /
DO NOT MERGE status and independent-review/release gates. No PR merge or close.

# Admin V1 R1 certification review - 2026-10-14

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_R1_CHANGES_REQUIRED (local review of 0331cc9/25140ba; reviewer
is the same agent that implemented R1, so not independent and no PASS possible).
Report: docs/admin/reviews/2026-10-14-r1-certification.md (+ r1-certification/
evidence and reviewer tools). No source change, push, deploy or remote access.

**Re-verified (clean worktree of 0331cc9):** full vitest 342 files/7865 tests
exit 0; lint/typecheck/build exit 0; customer dist/client byte-identical to
186a9cf (441 files) and identical Worker dry-run bundle; check:migrations ok;
migration matrix 11/11; implementer workerd checks 108/108; independent workerd
probe 1169/1169 (production positive control, 12 negative variants, real browser
on workerd, customer Worker parity); reviewer tests 18/18; original PoCs 51/51
before, 22/29 after with 0 unexplained; E2E 11/12 (axe 0, overflow 0) — the one
failure is a flaky keyboard-scroll assertion (product verified correct).

**Findings:** P1 F1 admin Worker has a writable binding to the production
customer DB and reads password hashes every request (needs read facade); P1 F2
two-SUPER_ADMIN governance deadlock without break-glass; P1 F3 no identity-bound
production bootstrap ceremony. P2 F4-F11: decider TOCTOU, non-atomic bootstrap,
pre-auth account lockout, full-scan aggregates, flaky E2E, E2E rewrites tracked
screenshots, deep-link charset, Access sub binding.

**Next:** fix F1-F3 (+P2), then a genuinely independent review; production stays
blocked on Access staging, admin workflows and the ceremony.

# Takosan Admin V1 security remediation R1 - 2026-10-13

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW (local only; not an
independent review PASS, not deployed). Implementation commit 25140ba; original
3e865d0 kept (tag admin-v1-review-baseline); review record 6889f8d. Report:
docs/admin/remediation-r1/REPORT.md (+ REGRESSION.md, evidence/). ADR-ADMIN-002.

**Changes:** console moved to a separate admin Worker (admin-worker.ts,
wrangler.admin.jsonc disabled template, wrangler.admin-local.jsonc loopback) with
its own ADMIN_DB (migrations-admin/0001). Customer Worker/config/sw/vite/ledger
restored to 186a9cf and 0042 withdrawn. Strict env allow-list, exact admin origin,
session-derived CSRF (no cookie), no CORS, two-person bootstrap, four-eyes
SUPER_ADMIN grant+revoke, DB minimum two, credential-change session revocation,
audit-before-disclosure, per-IP/account/global login limits, UI P1 fixes.

**Verification (clean worktree of 25140ba):** full vitest 342 files/7865 tests
PASS (exit 0); lint, typecheck, build PASS; check:migrations (customer + admin
smoke) PASS; admin vitest 10 files/133 tests; real workerd check 6/6 scenarios
(108 checks); S2 reproduced on 3e865d0 under workerd; migration matrix 11/11;
Playwright admin 12/12 (axe 0 violations, 0 px overflow at 1440/820/390);
original 51 PoCs: 51/51 on 3e865d0, 21/23 defect PoCs now fail on R1.
No GitHub/Cloudflare remote call, push, deploy or remote D1 access.

**Next:** independent review of R1; then (separately authorized) admin hostname,
Cloudflare Access app, ADMIN_DB + KV, reviewed admin-d1-migrate/admin-deploy
workflows, two-person bootstrap (PRODUCTION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).

# Takosan Admin Console V1 local implementation - 2026-10-12

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_LOCAL_COMPLETE (local only; not deployed, not production-certified).
Implemented separate admin frontend (`admin/index.html`, `src/admin/`), Worker admin
API (`src/worker/routes/admin/`, `/api/v1/admin/*`), shared RBAC/DTO contract
(`src/shared/admin.ts`), additive migration `0042_admin_console_foundation.sql`,
local-only fixture/provision/preview tooling (`scripts/admin-*.mjs`), and docs in
`docs/admin/` (API reference, RBAC matrix, security assessment, migration report,
integration plan, local setup, screenshots). ADR-ADMIN-001 records the authority model.
No GitHub/Cloudflare remote operation, deployment, remote migration or payment-code change.

**Verification (local, exact):** pnpm lint PASS; pnpm typecheck PASS (both projects);
pnpm build PASS (dist/client/admin/index.html + unchanged `index-*` customer entry);
pnpm check:migrations `migration-smoke=ok` incl. 0042 assertions; wrangler `--local`
D1 fresh replay 0001-0042 and 0041->0042 upgrade PASS; admin integration 30/30,
admin unit 37/37 (frontend + tooling); Playwright admin E2E 5/5 (Chromium, real Worker
serving built admin assets, synthetic fixture); full vitest 339 files/7799 tests: 7797 PASS, 2 FAIL
(auth-hardening + auth-otp-coordinator hard-coded the 0041 ledger tip/count); both now use
MIGRATION_LEDGER and pass on re-run (2 files/189 tests). Full suite not re-run after that
test-only fix.

**Compatibility edits:** customer service worker skips `/admin*`; rate limiter gained
optional `key`; `MIGRATION_LEDGER` + migration smoke include 0042. Production workflow
migration allow-lists and `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json` intentionally unchanged.

**Next:** Independent security review; real Cloudflare Access tenant verification;
define production SUPER_ADMIN bootstrap procedure; reviewed PR adding 0042 to the
production migrate allow-list; wire runtime `ai_requests` logging if AI metrics are
required. Production integration is a separately authorized operation
(docs/admin/PRODUCTION_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md).

# payOS Worker runtime correction - 2026-10-12 JST

**Status:** FIX_IMPLEMENTED_FOCUSED_VERIFIED; final hosted CI and replacement
staging/production deployments required. PR70 merged as
4fb7c40d01769f0d8d8d043fac0c799b435b3e3e. Final branch CI38236830274:
331files/7725tests PASS; merge CI38237818252 PASS. Staging deploy38238816115
and production deploy38239310493 PASS; actual production reviewer
vn-taphoanhatung. Concurrent production release38236084633 completed before merge.

**Operations:** Dedicated Tako-san channels have separate credentials uploaded
to frigo-staging/frigo. Both exact webhooks are provider-confirmed. Live signed
verification200, invalid401, malformed400, oversized413 and unauthenticated
issuance401 PASS. Stable merge4fb/config/origin/D1 identities verified, catalog
d1/canary0/plannerT20true preserved. No extra migration or protection change.
Temporary credentials remain private pending final setup verification.

**New failure and correction:** Authenticated production issuance returned502.
Actual workerd reproduces TypeError before outbound provider work because
redirect:error is unsupported at the edge. Node-only no-transfer tests had
passed and missed this runtime difference. The adapter now uses redirect:manual;
existing non-2xx rejection prevents following redirects or forwarding credentials.
Seven actual-workerd regressions fail before the fix; focused fivefiles/138tests
PASS after it, including redirect301/302/303/307/308 and forged-signature rejection.
Both PAYOS_CHECKOUT_ENABLED secret flags setfalse while replacement is prepared;
callbacks remain available. Checkout admission stays OFF independently.

**Next:** Finish local/full/hosted checks, normal PR/main merge, deploy staging,
verify actual app issuance, then protected production replacement with reviewer
approval. Enable and verify only after exact deployment. Owner-controlled bank
transfer and persisted Plus acceptance remain unverified; no fake grant or real
money movement. Historical checkpoints below are superseded by this entry.

# B00 backend baseline checkpoint - 2026-10-11 JST

**Task/status:** B00_BASELINE_COMPLETE_WITH_RECORDED_FINDINGS; docs/source/local baseline, backend runtime waves not implemented. Active packet `docs/backend-upgrade/tasks/B00-baseline.md`.

**Repository/source:** Canonical vn-tak/Tako-san, ID1385308553; worktree `/Users/tunbee27/.codex/worktrees/backend-b00-baseline/frigo`, branch `codex/backend-b00-baseline`, source base `652e0d7632745e9b77cda4b5b3caac83a3ec1015`. Documentation checkpoint prepared from this source; its own commit hash is intentionally not claimed here. Original Frigo legacy checkout/user untracked files retained. Old origin URL redirects to same repository ID.

**Actual changes:** Docs only: baseline migration/lock/catalog/V2 hashes,79routes/13groups, ownership/background effects, fresh hosted/public evidence, audit/validation, gap/release/PR triage, four detailed packets and B01-B08 supporting scopes. B00 decisions register accepted for documentation; runtime policy/key/cutover/V3/review decisions remain ADR drafts. No runtime source/migration/lockfile/flag/workflow edit.

**Executed checks:** Frozen install/lint/typecheck/local migration smoke/build/recipe-seed/ingredient-audit/refresh-check PASS. Initial full6743PASS/1Wrangler5s timeout; focused/CI-only also timeout.

**Database/operational state:** Only local synthetic SQLite/Worker test state and migration replay. No remote D1/R2/schema mutation, mail send, paid AI, push/PR/merge/settings change or deploy.

# Takosan Brand V3 - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** `TAKOSAN_BRAND_V3_PR_READY`, local scope; PR #66/hosted
CI tracked in `docs/brand/v3/CI_STATUS.md`. No merge or production deployment.

**Repository/source:** `vn-tak/Tako-san`, ID `1385308553`, main baseline
`652e0d7632745e9b77cda4b5b3caac83a3ec1015`, feature branch
`feat/takosan-brand-v3-full-integration`. Isolated checkout in projectless work/repo.
Implementation checkpoint `d35f4a68f4c2f6eb77f2a27742b5f1a3900075a7`.
PR: https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/pull/66.
Hosted validate đang chạy; không tính pending thành PASS.

**Actual change:** Canonical V3 contracts for legacy/kitchen; logo family, micro,
4 mascot, safe opaque PWA icons/OG, licensed self-host Nunito. Semantic mapping
scoped in one token authority with derived green text on soft surfaces; root legacy
payment states retained. Entry/header/sidebar/metadata/SW cache use V3. Curated
source/native/assets and five Vietnamese reports/evidence. No Worker/domain/auth
logic/payment config/services/stores/migrations/dependency/CI/deploy changes.

**Executed:** Input 83/83 digest/safety/dimensions; reproducible 49 exports; runtime 54
files / 269090 bytes; glyph/weight/license hashes. Full Vitest 289 files / 6749 tests PASS
with canonical local TMPDIR and 2 workers, no waiver. Types/full lint/local migration
smoke and both paired-flags builds PASS; focused brand 6 files / 68 tests PASS.
Production-build E2E 82 PASS / 4 failures: baseline ambiguous status selector H and
source-import instrumentation E unsupported in production, both repeated on baseline.
Auth resend/expiry 8 PASS. BEFORE 198 / AFTER 198 renders across 320..1440, zero final axe/
overflow/broken images/navigation clipping; supplemental 15 states / 2 journeys, 12 Week-off,
3 PWA checks PASS. Performance 3 cold/warm pairs / 3 routes, font transfer reduced, JS bundle
near unchanged, CLS Home~0.01765, zero measured domain writes/inventory unchanged.

**Failure disclosure:** Earlier full test run hit /var-vs-/private/var, missing
historical Git blobs and existing Wrangler 5s timeout; environment repaired and full
passed. Default dev preview bootstrap failed before app; production alternative
used real local cookie/Worker. Dependency audit existing 16 high / 2 critical, no package
changes; needs separate remediation. Heuristic UX script advisory FAIL; changed UI
manually checked against guidelines and dynamic a11y evidence. Not field CWV/device/
real Google login/email delivery/provider payment/native/screen-reader certification.

**Database/deployment:** Only synthetic in-memory local fixture mutations. No
remote credentials/secrets/migrations/deploy/production mutation or approval bypass.

**Next:** Review PR with actual final hosted CI, resolve baseline test/dependency
issues in scoped tasks, then owner-authorized staging/cache/device verification.
Do not infer production release authorization from local checks. Preserve other
open operational-doc PR histories when merging the prepend entries.

# UI10 - Thực đơn tuần đã kiểm chứng local - 2026-10-10 JST

**Task/status:** `UI10_LOCAL_VERIFIED_REVIEW_REQUIRED`, packet UI10, ADR-053.
Sáu trang Week, bốn component và workspace/choices/CSS chung hoàn tất trong phạm vi
local. Toàn hệ thống, navigation, owner/devices và hosted release chưa hoàn tất.

sau full; 51 public asset/font files sau build byte-identical. Protected-path diff
rỗng; store chỉ hai replacement receipt. 40 logs có raw/archive SHA256 receipts.
Implementation checkpoint:
`89bddf821ea4f74d639f0779febd78606bdf617f`.
Đã đối chiếu Git objects/worktree: 143 source hashes và 144 evidence payloads
khớp bytes/SHA256. Manifest: 29760 bytes, SHA256
`7ac94d4590e8c449ca4a1046e330871db4ce650bfda80329625595ac4d5618ab`.
Protected-path diff từ base đến implementation rỗng; tree sạch ngay sau commit;
`git diff --check` PASS. Documentation checkpoint theo sau, không ghi hash của chính nó.
Checkout Frigo cũ không được sửa.

**Actual changes:** WeekWorkspace dùng nhận diện UI07; board hai cột/stacked,
thumbnail nhỏ, body 14px/nhãn chính 16px, controls 48px, một h1 và back link rõ.
Setup bốn bước thực sự, 1-3 priorities, quay lại giữ chọn, review/generate tường
minh; bỏ lịch từng ngày không vào payload. Settings chỉ sửa bản nháp lần tạo tiếp
theo trong phiên, không hứa lưu bền vững hay thay plan hiện tại; bỏ timer.
Dashboard đưa về setup để xem lại; generation giữ null unlimited/undefined default.
Generation effect AST giữ ngoài mapping ngân sách; App.tsx byte-identical.
Meal/summary ghi rõ projection, unknown và empty. Swap/export có native controls,
focus trap/Escape/return, scroll/safe areas và reduced motion. Clipboard chờ kết
quả thật, phản hồi an toàn, xử lý share cancel và bỏ receipt đã rời dialog; giữ
hai export generator AST. Shopping check là lựa chọn, import explicit selected-only,
khóa lúc gửi, giữ snapshot và route/session fence. Optional pendingSync hiện có
đi từ store đến completion; copy thận trọng, chưa chứng minh durable outbox.

**Verification:** 11 files / 192 focused tests PASS 7.18s (34 mới, 158 hiện có).
Recovery route-scope: 5 files / 128 tests PASS 5.55s. Type/lint/script syntax PASS.
Browser 61 snapshots / 11 nhóm hành trình, 0 unexpected pageerror, applicable axe,
overflow và ảnh lỗi. 320/390/768/1024/1440px, short 390x420, computed text x2 tại
320px, chuỗi dài synthetic, normal/reduced motion. Worker local flag-off tạo/đọc/
swap giữ toàn inventory JSON; import một selected ingredient, đúng quantity/unit,
giữ mọi field của năm row cũ và reload readback nhất quán. Synthetic faults/pending
receipt ghi riêng, không claim offline durability. Planner-on bảy aliases thật,
không Week write/pageerror; actual App unit tests kiểm cả hai flags. T18C keyboard
sáu projects PASS 15.1s, config local riêng giữ timeout/projects của repo.
Full command:

smoke/Vite 3.12s + Worker TypeScript build PASS. Remote schema/Week parity không chạy.
Round-10 FOUNDATION/VERIFICATION, final-validation và contact sheets lưu bằng chứng.

**Failures/recovery:** Initial type/script errors, DOMException cancellation,
alias expectations/mocks và T18C controls được sửa theo contract thật. Browser
wait nhầm generating, lazy image chờ ngoài viewport, dl semantics và memory/pending
fixtures được sửa; eager image chỉ trong screenshot harness. Visual text x2 dẫn
đến sửa line-height, step label wrap và heading CTA. Preliminary full bị dừng vì
finding cuối ở CSS. Lượt full kế tiếp exit 1: 283 files, 6642 PASS / 7 FAIL, 525.94s;
sáu assertion cũ coi Week chưa migrate và một Wrangler timeout 5000ms. Reproduction
riêng xác nhận sáu assertion; Wrangler nguyên trạng đạt. Bốn file test sửa đúng
route mới, giữ negative coverage và thêm bốn positive cases; recovery 128 PASS.
Không đổi timeout/config. Final generic UX: 151 files / 29 issues / 968 warnings /
82 checks, STATUS FAIL (lượt trước 970 warnings). Dependency audit exit 1:
41 advisories (4 low, 19 moderate, 16 high, 2 critical), lockfile nguyên.

**Database/operational state:** Worker synthetic local/in-memory SQLite. Owned

projection và inventory fallback-any-error/queued metadata receipts còn riêng.
Catalog còn thiếu ảnh/placeholder; export giữ domain lịch sử; global nav chật: UI11.
Owner/device/Safari/native zoom/screen reader/usability/CWV/hosted chưa kiểm chứng.

**Next action:** `docs/ai/tasks/UI11-navigation-responsive.md`: audit shared nav,

Giữ năm root destinations, Scan, flags, immersive và protected semantics. Kiểm
browser local/meaningful tests/full gates và source/evidence/Git checkpoints.
Domain offline, dependencies, media, owner/device và hosted follow-ups vẫn riêng.

**Actual changes:** Planner và saved shopping dùng KitchenHeader, pine/coral,
warm canvas và Be Vietnam Pro. Board 1/2/3 cột theo container; setup có form và
ngữ cảnh, shopping tách summary/nhu cầu. Controls >=48px, fields >=16px; amount/
unit xuống một cột khi hẹp, header/action wrap, line-height và nút theo nội dung
khi phóng chữ. Day reveal hỗ trợ reduced motion; dialog xóa có confirm và scroll
limit. Picker hiện đủ tên/count/empty/reset, kết thúc pending khi search lỗi và
hiện/focus mutation error trong modal.

Planner workspace theo pathname chặn callback cũ nhận kết quả hoặc điều hướng;
server/query cache giữ plan đã lưu. Giữ V1/V2/404 fallback, revision, proposal,
hard constraints và Week contract. Saved form hỗ trợ lượng thập phân dương,

hẹp chuyển input/unit và +/- thành hai hàng để số không bị ép khi phóng chữ.

Immutable payload/key từ confirm đầu, single flight, uncertain retry cùng yêu cầu;

outbox persistence kiểm chứng, projection trước attempt và same/concurrent key

Documentation checkpoint theo sau; checkout Frigo cũ giữ nguyên.

**Actual changes:** Scan → review → sửa → explicit confirm → inventory dùng cùng
ReviewHeading/Summary, ReviewFields, source preview gắn đúng scan ID và responsive
kitchen-scan CSS. Pine/coral/warm canvas và Be Vietnam Pro giữ identity prototype;
camera workspace riêng, review có navigation. Desktop hai cột, mobile một cột,
input16px/48px, 8 đơn vị, short viewport dùng action trong document flow. Camera
fallback thư viện, tips details và chọn ảnh khác sau lỗi. Không còn timer giả
queue/AI/validation; upload đang gửi, pending/processing theo DTO. Reduced motion

Accepted fields kiểm tra tên/lượng hữu hạn >0≤10000/ngày trước programmatic submit;
blank không thành0/1. Dòng photo rejected disabled và gửi ID+rejected để server giữ
evidence gốc. Offline synthetic import bỏ rejected, validate toàn bộ accepted
quantity trước mutation, import0 không báo pendingSync, giữ expiryEstimated và
UNKNOWN/KNOWN/ESTIMATED projection.
Photo pendingSync có feedback, khóa sửa/confirm; rời review xóa queued ready draft
trong đúng session/scan, quay lại hydrate trạng thái máy chủ. Camera effect dừng
đúng stream và late response; đổi mode/new image hủy image read, reset input cho
chọn lại cùng file. Source ảnh chỉ memory và bind đúng ID từ upload response;
không tự nhận ảnh cũ khi hydrate. Receipt ingredient lookup đúng rawName/canonical.

# Production scan telemetry recovered; bounded validation repair candidate - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout remains INCOMPLETE. Frozen deployed source/main
is `0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`; shadow Worker
`f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b` remains shadow/0%/cutover false,
global static, T20 false. Migration 37689543237 APPLIED only0039 and certification
37693128721 PASS. No canary dispatched; never replay0039 or recovery37536969564.
Operator excludes user-data retention certification because no real users exist.

**Confirmed telemetry:** The operator completed separately scoped Cloudflare API
MCP OAuth, including telemetry-query permission. Bounded `dry=true` queries retrieved
four scan events and seven events from the same invocation, verified against account
hash, Worker version, service, 50-second window, support hash `b6db841cbed9`, request
and trace IDs. OCR attempts1/2 on qwen-vl-ocr each returned SCHEMA_VALIDATION,
611 output tokens; escalation attempt3 on qwen3.8-flash returned INVALID_RESPONSE,
2 output tokens. This supersedes the previous log-access blocker. Schema fields and
escalation parsing branch were not logged; equal token counts do not prove equal
content. The original scan/fixture bytes remain missing and the scan was not replayed.

**Candidate changes:** On `codex/ai-scan-validation-diagnostics`, propagate only
fixed schema field paths and Zod codes (deduplicated, maximum8) into existing bounded
scan repair feedback and `ai_usage`; emit fixed invalid-envelope/empty-content/
unparseable-content/empty-items stages. Revalidate the diagnostic allowlist at Worker
logging. Unknown field names, item indexes, Zod messages/received values and raw
provider content are excluded. Public error codes, validation/quality gates, provider
models, token/call limits, queue fencing, payments and auth are unchanged. This fixes
lost actionable schema feedback and missing diagnostic precision, not a proved live
receipt-schema root cause. No live provider success is claimed.

**Checks:** Initial regression import failed before module creation; with a no-op
module, all6 regression assertions failed as expected. Initial focused6files/87tests
PASS. Final focused9files/109tests PASS4.75s, including adversarial log redaction,
bounded/deduplicated paths, repair prompts, provider stages and queue retry/fencing.
Final `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, migration smoke and build PASS. Full suite
with Node24/TMPDIR=/private/tmp/CI=true/maxWorkers2:255files PASS/1failed,
6315tests PASS/1failed348.06s; the unchanged local Wrangler staging-startup test
exceeded its5s timeout. Isolated unchanged rerun32/32PASS3.31s, actual Wrangler
case1099ms. No full local PASS is claimed. Source/release self-review found no
remaining concrete issue; it is not independent review. Public provider success
still requires new-release validation. Implementation checkpoint `648dbd32010363712f219d25ca0b5109db37c3d3`.
No production write, Worker change or new scan occurred in this diagnostic continuation.

**Checkpoint/source:** Detailed evidence and continuation:
[Production shadow diagnostic](docs/ai/scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).
The former documentation checkpoint is `a29af19`; credentials/raw telemetry remain
ignored under `.wrangler/production-evidence/20261008`. Do not publish raw logs,
account IDs, receipt data or OAuth tokens. R2 bytes and email delivery remain unverified.

**Next action:** Finish checks and source review, normal PR/exact-head CI/merge and
exact-main CI, then revalidate the frozen new source through protected deployment
and a distinct non-PII provider validation. Original failed scan must not be replayed.
If validation still fails, use the new correlated diagnostics to isolate a smallest
justified fix. Only a passing provider gate permits production1/5/25/D1, each with
normal independent Environment approval. No review bypass or migration replay.

All preceding checkpoints below are historical.

# Production shadow verified; AI diagnosis blocked on historical logs - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout INCOMPLETE. Frozen release/main is
`0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`, exact-main CI `37686743768`
SUCCESS. Migration `37689543237` APPLIED only 0039; read-only certification
`37693128721` PASS; production shadow `37763248411` SUCCESS. Each received
normal independent Environment approval by `vn-taphoanhatung`. No canary run
has been dispatched. T20 server/UI remain false; user-data retention certification
is excluded by the operator's instruction.

**Actual production:** Worker `f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b`, deployment
`7f2f522f-c9cf-4762-9022-3435ae7e6e38`, shadow/0%/cutover false/global static.
Schema 39, 500 hydrated recipes, zero hydration failures, 500 valid ready media;
FK clean and quick_check ok. Three new public readiness/service-worker pairs
PASS through `2026-10-08T11:48:52.379Z`: exact source/assets, healthy DB/queue,
config OK, no fallback. Shadow's hosted gates passed 255 files / 6309 tests
(438.75s). Email delivery and current R2 object bytes remain unverified.

**AI blocker:** One synthetic scan on this shadow release was accepted 202 and
ended FAILED / INVALID_RESPONSE / queue attempt 1 / max 3 / items 0, support hash
`b6db841cbed9`, at 10:41:55-10:42:33 UTC (19:41:55-19:42:33 JST). Logout was 200.
Its original fixture/receipt bytes disappeared during session interruption.
Recovered conversation history is explicitly labelled and cannot certify original
receipt bytes or accuracy. Do not resubmit this scan. No confirmed live root cause
or new AI behavior change: malformed envelope, empty content, unparseable content
and empty items can share this code; queue attempt 1 can include multiple provider
calls. Historical `ai_usage` and `scan_terminal` are needed before selecting a fix.

**Recovery/checks:** Re-downloaded all six GitHub candidate/receipt ZIPs; verified
API digests, archive provenance, exact extracted JSON bytes, run/attempt/SHA/CI,
normal approvals, and cross-receipt catalog/media/ledger/Worker invariants.
Account identity matched the certified hash after successful restricted CLI login.
One bounded historical log query (frigo only, 50 seconds, dry=true) was rejected
HTTP 403 / API 10000. Official endpoint requires Workers Observability Write;
OAuth has only account:read/workers_tail:read/offline_access. No scope expansion,
new provider submission, database write, Worker change or Environment bypass.
Original operator wrappers/control receipts and staging private packet are missing;
previous observations remain historical, not newly reverified executable evidence.

**Checkpoint/source:** This documentation stays on `codex/post-media-rollout-evidence`,
separate from frozen production main. Implementation remains reviewed `df2347ca`,
merged via PR58/main `0c777203`. Previous local test/hash-pin and concurrent build
failures are preserved below; no new full local suite is claimed for this docs edit.
Detailed digests, executed recovery commands and restart instructions:
[Production shadow diagnostic](docs/ai/scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).

**Next action:** Obtain sanitized historical `ai_usage` + matching `scan_terminal`
metadata via Cloudflare Logs for the window above. The restricted CLI received 403;
operator was asked to provide metadata, without credentials or receipt content.
Then isolate the cause, add a meaningful regression and the smallest justified fix,
normal review/CI/merge and validation of any changed final source before a distinct
provider validation. Promote 1/5/25/D1 only after the provider gate passes. Never
replay migration 0039 or recovery `37536969564`, or bypass Environment review.

All preceding checkpoints below are historical.

# Post-media gate implementation and verification - 2026-10-08 JST

**State:** Implementationdf2347caf414537c287e11defae0b87f8377cec7/tree
7350e86740d246ace03ddb0bd86de522025d03d5 exactly matches independent reviewed
complete tree. Draft PR58 is open. Production remains old healthy static136cb6ff;
ledger38/0038 and recoveryAPPLIED. No production mutation/deploy/provider scan.

**Changes:** Complete0038/0039 catalogs require19 safe aggregates, valid active
hero coverage and actual domain metadata; historical pending-only gates remain.
Generic verification and 0039 preflight validate immutable0035 schema definitions.
The preflight privately reads all18media columns, validates actual rows through
the real mapper/auditor and recomputes coverage/uniqueness. It binds the rowcount
and full metadata/schema SHA256 before migration; post0039 must preserve them.
Only aggregate counts/digests are uploaded. No runtime/config/applied migration,
dependency/credential/Environment policy or protected payment/auth change.

**Review:** Two independent reviews report no remaining concrete blocker after
fixing stale aggregate acceptance of a newly invalid private row. Source review
and actual CLI controls PASS. This proves persisted metadata and observed
non-atomic preservation, not fresh R2 bytes. ADR042 records these limits.

**Executed checks:** Node24 focused5files/98tests PASS40.23s; core migration114/114

No assertion or mutation guard is removed; full local PASS is not claimed.

**Build:** An initial build run during active Vite loaders failed the existing
service-worker token guard; retained log records that failure. After all test/CLI
loaders exited, the exact same build command PASS serially without source changes.
Concurrent output mutation is the observed limitation, not an application repair.

# Post-media migration gate repair - 2026-10-08 JST

**State:** Production release is incomplete. Normally approved read-only diagnostic
37681758263 completed with an intentional catalog gate rejection. Independent
actual artifact/API audit PASS: five ZIP digests and extracted bytes, exact main
282e564faaa7c608fa5617f65bb48d453d8e2fcd, successful CI37680537546 and normal
reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. The final main fence and sanitized uploads succeeded.
No production mutation occurred. Ledger remains38/0038; recovery37536969564 is
APPLIED and must not be replayed.

**Confirmed cause:** Runtime PASS proves500 recipes,0 hydration failures and
fingerprint f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37.
Catalog order0..499, IDs/slugs, provenance, ingredient/step/order coverage and
repeat-capture stability PASS. The old gate rejects media_ready=500 and
recipes_without_pending_hero=500 because it encodes the historical pre-media
rollout condition. These counts do not yet prove per-recipe ready hero coverage,
valid metadata or current R2 bytes. The earlier missing-pending hypothesis is

full-suite success does not change that recorded local limitation.

**Prior production diagnosis:** Normally approved37616546408 SUCCESS proves500

rows and stable observed non-atomic snapshots at ledger38/0038. It does not prove
live full runtime fingerprint, complete ordered IDs/slugs or pending hero/media
invariants. Missing0039 in that diagnostic's baseline is expected and does not
explain the preflight failure of migration37615237481. Recovery is alreadyAPPLIED;
no replay, blind migration retry or rollback followed.

**Implementation:** Reviewed3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d adds sanitized
read-only preflight diagnostics with unchanged catalog/runtime verifiers, complete
38-prefix ledger fencing, repeated successful snapshots and fixed error enums.
Failed queries cannot reuse stale JSON. Only safe aggregates/counts/hashes are
published. The final main fence executes after rejected diagnosis. Runtime,
config, migrations, credentials, dependencies and Environment policy are unchanged.

**Local investigation:** The exact historical recovery plan was recompiled from
a8fa0324bb609274cc07a5c4b079e7ee4633fd83 with original SQL SHA
e5a58960baa4b8e1f4cae8be94985dd03cf4e9acf03c274b38fb310ce79f28c0.
Four local controls PASS: recovery preserves recipe_media, so missing/duplicate
pending heroes can survive an APPLIED V1 catalog with500hydrated recipes and exact
runtime fingerprint while verifyCatalogAtTip rejects it. Runtime order is restored
from1000..1499 to0..499 by the same plan. This is a source/local hypothesis only;
live media state still requires the new protected read-only diagnostic.

**Preparation:** Fresh local-only pinned282e catalog source proof PASS:769source

# Catalog preflight diagnostic implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Production diagnostic
37616546408 completed SUCCESS at 2026-10-07T12:17:44Z on main
969d1d3735b85913c9b1dfe6ae4df2eba40e98b6 with normal independent approval by
vn-taphoanhatung. Five actual artifact ZIP digests and extracted JSON bytes PASS
in independent audit. Ledger stays 38 / 0038; 500 physical and hydrated recipes,
0 hydration failures, 2702 ingredients and matching order rows, exact historical
V1 ingredient lines/positions and stable observed non-atomic snapshots are proven.
The missing 0039 diagnostic baseline is expected and does not explain migration
37615237481's catalog preflight failure. T21R-B fingerprintVerified proves the
target V1 source, not the live full runtime fingerprint. Live ordered IDs/slugs,
media invariants and full runtime fingerprint remain unproven. Recovery is already
APPLIED; no recovery replay, blind migration retry or rollback is justified.

**Changes:** Implementation 3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d, tree
c79bda74d06d7b0637eb034b3057e2df1eecf636, adds a read-only catalog preflight
receipt to the existing protected diagnostic workflow. The helper reuses unchanged
verifyCatalogAtTip and verifyRuntimeCatalogContent at exact ledger 38, requires
repeat successful catalog/runtime captures and an unchanged complete ledger, and
reports independent PASS/REJECTED/NOT_EVALUATED checks. Only 13 numeric/null
aggregates, counts, hashes and fixed reason enums are uploaded; raw rows and
exception messages stay private. Failed captures cannot reuse stale JSON. Stable
non-atomic consistency is claimed only when ledger and both snapshot comparisons
PASS. The final main fence runs even after a rejected diagnostic. No production
write, runtime/migration/config/dependency or Environment-policy change.

**Verification:** Final helper tests 38/38 PASS under Node 24.16; final exact
Node 22.23.3 focused tests 3 files / 58 tests PASS (35.73s). Independent final
review of implementation/tree reports no remaining finding. Actual CLI controls
7/7 and exact workflow-shell stale JSON/provider-failure controls 5/5 PASS, with
0 production calls; official Node 22 CLI controls 4/4 PASS. Final lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, script
syntax, actionlint 1.7.12 and diff checks PASS. Default local full suite returned 3 failed
files / 12 failed / 6186 passed (179.65s): untouched capture tests compare
uncanonical macOS /var temp paths with real /private/var paths, and the local
Wrangler prefix test timed out under default concurrent workers. No tests were
weakened. Independent focused3files/125tests PASS4.58s with canonical TMPDIR
and maxWorkers=2; the two capture files reproduce the same11 failures with the
uncanonical default TMPDIR even with two workers. All eight involved source/test
files are byte-identical between969d and the implementation. Exact resource
bottleneck of the concurrency-sensitive Wrangler timeout was not profiled. Full
canonical-TMPDIR/maxWorkers=2 regression completed 253 passed / 1 failed files,
6197 passed / 1 failed tests (328.71s). The remaining unchanged local Wrangler
catchup test took33.993s and timed out at its existing5s bound; it passed1.745s
in focused verification. All new38tests passed in both full runs. Draft PR57
CI37624949372 is pending; no local full-suite PASS is claimed.
One actionlint invocation used a nonexistent certify filename; corrected to the
actual production-certify.yml and all four affected release workflows PASS.

**Production:** Public readiness at 2026-10-07T12:53:19.214Z remains healthy old
Worker 136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f / static / 0% / cutover false,

frozen at 969d1d.

**Migration:** Run 37615237481 was approved normally by vn-taphoanhatung and its
frozen-toolchain/exact-SHA gate passed. Production identity and ledger 38 / 0038
were verified, then Require healthy current catalog before migration 0039 FAILED.
Bookmark, baseline, plan, apply and every post-check were SKIPPED; this run did
not apply 0039 or upload a Worker. No recovery replay or catalog rollback followed.
Both candidate/receipt artifact ZIP digests and extracted manifest bytes PASS in
root and independent audit. The sanitized receipt lacks the specific preflight
failure reason and raw query outputs, so the cause remains UNKNOWN. Prior inspect
APPLIED proves recovered rows/shape/counts, not complete runtime/media release proof.

**Reproduction:** The actual failure manifest plus fresh immutable 0038 V1 local

Main remains5b12ab71acd84beec62be967c950b12d596c88d7 while the small fix is reviewed.

**Change:** Branch codex/migration-gate-toolchain adds pinned pnpm setup10 and
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile before the production migration gate. The already
locked TypeScript dependency is now available on a fresh runner. No package,

# Import confirmation implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Recovery37536969564 was normally
approved and has ATTEMPTED_COMPLETION_UNCONFIRMED at BOOKMARK_AND_IMPORT, without
importFailure or provider code. This supersedes any earlier claim that all incidents
are absent; its exact namespace has not yet been inspected remotely. No subsequent
retry/rollback/0039/application deployment has occurred.

**Changes:** Branch codex/production-import-json-confirmation adds a strict pinned
Wrangler file-import stdout parser and a third sealed SELECT-only inspector for
37536969564/a8fa. Historical incident definitions and compiler bytes are preserved.
The runner saves and repeats the third capture, and requires absent/stable/all-eight
primary guards/no failed reads before any future restore pin/bookmark/import. Query
JSON remains strict. Unknown completion retains sanitized OUTPUT_UNCONFIRMED and
never starts an automatic rollback. Marker observations are not full catalog
certification or provider-terminal evidence; UNKNOWN_NO_CURSOR/retryAuthorized=false
remain explicit. No runtime, migration, payment/auth or Environment policy change.

**Evidence:** Root independently reproduced the third plan receipt exactly against
the retained production artifact:296/36 statements and both SQL hashes PASS.
Implementation checkpoint244a43b includes the final reviewed source. Root final
runner/auth/parser focused3files/194tests PASS36.51s (runner75/auth13/parser106);
inspector163/163 PASS44.27s. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, actionlint1.7.12,
script syntax and diff checks PASS. Both independent reviews report no remaining
blocker after tightening contradictory optional metadata. The first exploratory
full suite was deliberately stopped(exit143) for that final code/test change;
it is not claimed PASS or a regression failure. Full final-source suite PASS:
253files/6160tests,341.60s,Node24.16,maxWorkers2. Hosted final-head/main CI remains pending.
Inspector's first focused attempt had one fixture-only rollback guard failure; it
was corrected by separating drift and real rollback cases, then163/163 PASS.
No live database completion follows from these local tests.

**Next:** Finish parser tightening, full gates and independent final review; publish
and merge a normal PR, require exact-main CI and dispatch one protected inspect-import
with its final reviewed implementation head. Obtain normal vn-taphoanhatung review,
retain sanitized evidence and choose action from the actual third incident. Applied

D1 Read retained and D1 Write added. Reopening the persisted token verifies
Read=1/Edit=1/Active. Existing entire-account resource, no expiry and all-IP policy

**Confirmed parser defect:** Independent offline replay of verbatim pinned
Wrangler3.114.17 Handler/execute/import/spinner functions with mocked provider
responsesPASS, no network/productionmutation. Both successful upload and cached
init paths return nonempty all-success arrays but prepend spinner stdout even
under --json/loggerLevelerror. Full stdoutJSON.parse fails; --command query control
is cleanJSON. Runner's file-import parser therefore rejects legitimate successful
output. This explains a possible post-success parse failure and the missing
importFailure field; actual production import commit remains UNCONFIRMED until
inspection of this exact new repair prefix. No blind retry/rollback/0039.

500 version2 recipes,6720 ingredient lines,0 order rows,0 hydrated recipes and
500 missing_ingredient_position failures. This diagnostic success does not certify
release or settle recovery37384670328 provider completion. No blind retry,
rollback,0039 or promotion. User authorizes production release and confirms no
real users; user-data preservation certification is excluded.

**Changes:** PR51 final d70d644e5d4e953ebe02894a28cf8fe4c110006e passed hosted

 d2108588e4dfbccba6dbe75ab5fd0005330ae38d has identical complete reviewed tree;
exact-main CI37456321861 SUCCESS (250files/5736tests/288.01s plus all gates),
registration37456321763 SUCCESS with no
production access. New inspect-import operation under implementation on
codex/production-import-inspection is fixed to failed recovery37384670328.
It reads exact repair objects and compiler-derived pre-mutation guard booleans,
re-proves original static100% Worker/ledger before and after and compares two
aggregate captures. No SQL file import, pin, rollback or migration path runs.
Existing normal independent Environment approval/full-reviewed-tree/CI gates
remain. Hypotheses about protected internal-table PRAGMA or completion parsing
are unproved; recovery compiler and mutation behavior are unchanged.

**Checks:** Initial focused runner/auth43 had42PASS/1FAIL: real-helper guard

No new remote inspection dispatch or production mutation has run.

**Production:** Last verified pin is old-source136cb6ff/static0/false,100%

Recovery37384670328 lost import completion after this pin/bookmark; no automatic
rollback or post-import certification ran. Exact repair objects and provider
blocking status still need inspection. Cloudflare import poll requires the lost
at_bookmark; Time Travel bookmark is not an equivalent cursor. Successful primary
SELECTs can prove no blocking import at observation times, not a terminal reason.

**Next:** Finish bounded helper/tests/full repository gates and independent
review; publish PR, final-head CI, normal merge and exact-main CI. Dispatch one
inspect-import, freeze main and obtain normal reviewer vn-taphoanhatung approval.

# Production asset convergence checkpoint - 2026-10-06 JST

**State:** Release incomplete. Remote main stays
f2b00023ccb9a706d17ebe71321c0364a948ca75 while read-only diagnostics 37450399162
waits for the required production reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. Recovery 37384670328
was normally approved and FAILED with import completion unconfirmed after a
successful static pin. CLI vn-tak cannot approve. No blind retry, rollback or
migration is authorized by this ambiguous result. The operator authorizes release
and confirms no real users; user-data preservation certification is excluded.

**Changes:** Executable a9f1c81582677d4b40806c388d27892edeec1f44 pairs exact
readiness/approved authority with same-origin /sw.js before counting each of three
consecutive observations. Only an otherwise-valid SW with a different canonical
full SHA retries. The existing 90-second shared budget includes request/body time;
no request starts at zero budget. The 256 KiB body limit, HTTP/MIME/no-store/syntax/
strict BUILD_ID/SW marker checks and sanitized errors fail closed. CLI writes a
separate deployedAssets proof; original deployed shape/workflow/smoke are unchanged.

**Checks:** New assets RED 43 fail; final focused 331 PASS, independently rerun by
root. First full suite FAILED: 249 files / 5735 tests PASS, one unrelated catch-up
Wrangler test exceeded unchanged 5000 ms timeout; exit 1 / 512.97 seconds. Isolated
unchanged suite 32 PASS in 3.04 seconds (Wrangler case 919 ms). Cause unproven; no
test/timeout edits. Final full rerun without parallel Wrangler/build: 250 files /
5736 tests PASS, exit 0 / 490.18 seconds. Serial build, lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, syntax and diff PASS. Root reviewed frozen source/tests with no concrete
blocker. A first additional review attempt was unavailable; the later independent
frozen review completed with no blockers,331/331PASS (2.06s), ESLint/diff PASS and
all three file hashes matching the freeze. Shape/BUILD_ID and observed bytes are
proved, not semantic SW execution or complete HTML/JS bundle content.
PR51 head 93e3db2004c518af7694edd4db89e918510c5d72 passed hosted CI37452057402:
250files/5736tests (198.73s), lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build. PR remains OPEN
and held while diagnostics waits. This new documentation-only checkpoint still
needs final-head hosted CI; exact merged-main CI remains required after merge.
Local isolated recovery SQL probes did not complete (exit143/137); they provide no
import outcome or remote-cause proof. No credentials/remote mutation were used.

**Remote:** Staging 37384738093 FAILED after Worker publication and three exact
readiness observations: /sw.js had not embedded expected f2b. Failed body not
retained, actual prior SHA unknown. Protected authority step did not run; no new
recipeAuthority proof/canary exists. Later public SW/smoke converged. New native
CLI public GET-only rehearsal PASS at 2026-10-06T10:25:27.065Z: three exact pairs /
7907 ms. Separate /tmp manifest preserves the original artifact. This does not
certify protected 500/fingerprint or turn the failed workflow into a success.

**Production:** Recovery proved ledger 38/0038 and 7409664 database bytes, cloned
modules/runtime/bindings/assets, changed only three catalog variables to static/
0/false and confirmed 100% version 1a47f7f7-3d74-4801-b26a-b91f39c7942e.
Bookmark captured. Import then failed at BOOKMARK_AND_IMPORT with
IMPORT_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN_STATIC_OPERATOR_INSPECTION_REQUIRED /

0963a326ff12c085ce62737096928dbb6d669485a432865cf5a31deaca9bea45.

**Next:** Obtain normal review for read-only 37450399162, inspect stable catalog/
ledger and resolve the unknown import state from evidence. Keep main fixed during
pending operations. Require independently certified V1/static/ledger 38/500/exact

**Status: `T21RC2_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.** Correct branch
`codex/t21rc2-protected-production-row-read`, certified base
`518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`, repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`.
Actual dispatch-only workflow/four scripts/four suites implemented; existing
classifier/schema and T19/T20 untouched. Verified executable checkpoint `ad7b3012`
normally published with exact local/provider equality; no PR or merge.
Old local `9542e112` is preserved and excluded, not C2 implementation or ancestry.

Focused PASS: 8 files / 455 tests (C2 146, predecessor 73, release-check 236).
Full `pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS: 230 files / 5,109 tests.
Lint/typecheck/local migration smoke/build/syntax/diff PASS; independent agent
review found no material defect. Initial setup/integration failures are recorded;
no timeout/assertion weakened. Production/Cloudflare calls/dispatches/approvals/
mutations/applies/restores/deploys: 0. Row delivery `UNCONFIGURED`.
Next: independent review of the actual executable implementation before any
production authorization. `T21G_NOT_READY`; repair NOT_AUTHORIZED, 0039/deploy STOPPED.
Exact checks/options/failures: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T21RC2_PROTECTED_PRODUCTION_ROW_READ.md`.

# Current — T21R-C P1-only remediation (2026-10-02 UTC)

Reviewed parent `32ab51d`, branch `codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation`;
repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`. Explicit balanced-tuple
satisfaction and direct V1-over-bridge precedence; six regression cases added.
`T21RC_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`: 57 T21R-C / 73 focused PASS, all other
required local gates PASS; full single-worker suite PASS, 226 files / 4,963 tests.
No schema/taxonomy/runtime/authority/workflow/
migration/dependency change, PR or production operation.
Next: independent delta review of the single normally published remediation
checkpoint after `32ab51d`; no self-approval or production preparation.

# Current — T21R-C protected row evidence (2026-10-02 UTC)

**Status: `T21RC_OFFLINE_DESIGN_READY`.** Offline classifier/schema/read design completed on
`codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation` from verified `a828b6354e29d89268a3d11c874158eb5ecb997c`,
repository ID `1385308553` (`vn-tako4/Tako-san`). Focused 67/67 (51 new + 16
regressions), offline source/CLI/Ajv checks, lint/typecheck/local migration
smoke/build/diff PASS. Full two-worker suite: 4,956 passed, one existing
5-second certification test timeout; final unchanged one-worker full run PASS,
226 files / 4,957 tests. Verified local implementation checkpoint `ec24101`.

Run `36943692146/1` aggregates accepted for review; admin-bypass exception is
separate (approval history `skipped` by `vn-tako4`). No new production read,
raw-row upload, mutation, restore, migration/0039 apply, deploy, flags, push,
PR or merge. V1 remains authority; `T21G_NOT_READY`; repair/0039/deploy STOPPED.

# Current — T19 cooking hard-restriction hotfix (2026-09-28)

**Status: `T19_COOKING_HARD_RESTRICTION_HOTFIX_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.** Branch
`fix/t19-cooking-hard-restriction-bypass` from `85660fa`. cook/start +
cook/complete now enforce canonical hard restrictions (422
`HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`, fail-closed). Deploy/D1/migration/secret/config: NO.
Staging stays canary 1%. Next: PR + review/merge; do NOT promote canary.

---

# Current — T19-R0 staging D1 runtime readiness certifier (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T19_STAGING_D1_RUNTIME_READINESS_FIX_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.** Deploy/D1 mutation/T20/authority: NO.
Read-only staging certifier + workflow on `61bf805`. Wait for review/merge;
do not dispatch until exact-main CI.

---

# Current — T20-R1 staging release observability (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_RELEASE_OBSERVABILITY_FIX_IN_REVIEW`. Deploy/T20/production: NO.**
Staging now captures and proves the serving recipe-authority Worker before
deploy; the post-deploy proof retries only that exact previous Worker and still
requires the exact release commit to pass (ADR-034).

---

# Current — T20 staging rollout preflight (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_BLOCKED_RELEASE_OBSERVABILITY`. T20 enablement: NO.**
Main `0b2e0a17…`. Staging 0039 certified. Local T20/runtime gates PASS.
Do not dispatch Deploy (`meal_composition_v2_enabled=true`) until staging
`/health/recipe-authority` commit matches this SHA (failed on `36285175574`).

# Current — Staging D1 0033→0038 historical catch-up (2026-09-26)

**Status: `STAGING_D1_0033_0038_CATCHUP_PR_READY`. Remote D1 mutation: NO.**
Branch `feat/staging-d1-catchup-0033-0038` from `origin/main` `8147dde`.
Implementation `718abef`.

- [done] Dedicated staging-only historical catch-up workflow and checker.
- [done] One migration per run; prefix isolation excludes 0039.
- [done] Local 0033–0038 replay certified.
- [done] Existing 0039 staging migrate workflow left authoritative for 0038→0039.
- [done] Review remediation: full pre-state checkpoint certification blocks
  mutation on 0034–0037 checkpoint drift; apply-gate; repository id required.
- [open] PR review/merge. No remote catch-up dispatch until then.

Next authorized step after merge: dispatch target=0034 only, inspect receipt,
stop. Do not chain 0034–0038 automatically.

# Current — Ingredient icon pack v2 (2026-09-27)

**Status: `ICON_V2_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_GATES_RUNNING`. Remote systems:
`UNTOUCHED`.** Branch `feat/ingredient-icons-v2` from `origin/main` `8687ff9`.

- [done] Audit old `getIngredientImage` if-chain on real data: 43.3% tomato
  fallback, 18/48 PNGs unreferenced, mis-matches (cá lóc→salmon, dầu mè→oil,
  trái bơ→butter).
- [done] Add 39 new transparent PNGs to `public/frigo/ingredients/`
  (15 vegetables, 16 pantry, 8 generic category icons).
- [done] Add 214-rule `src/web/lib/ingredient-icon-rules.json` (single source
  of truth, ordered most-specific-first) + rewrite `ingredient-images.ts` as
  data-driven matcher (exact ID → Vietnamese substring → unaccented
  word-boundary → category fallback → tomato last resort).
- [done] Fix phase-1 ambiguous bare keywords: unaccented input no longer
  matches `me`/`chao` ("Me"→category-other, not tamarind).
- [done] Pre-PR semantic audit of grouped keywords (ngao→seafood,
  hương thảo→spice, pate→meat, đá viên→water…): all land on truthful
  category icons; kept.
- [done] `tests/unit/ingredient-images.test.ts` (7 tests): ordering,
  unaccented, no-guess, fallback, backward compat, asset existence on disk.
- [done] `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm build` PASS,
  `pnpm check:migrations` PASS, focused vitest 7/7 PASS,
  `vitest run tests/unit` 116 files / 2,460 PASS (pre-rebase),
  post-rebase 119 files / 2,478 PASS (incl. 18 new PR #12 tests),
  integration chunk 1 (22 files) 1,138 passed / 8 skipped.
  Sandbox confirmation gates stop long local runs; remaining integration
  chunks go through hosted PR CI (no integration/e2e test covers icons).
- [done] PR #13 opened (`feat/ingredient-icons-v2` → `main`,
  head `95e21c2e`), body lists local gates + reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung`.
- [monitoring] Hosted exact-head CI on PR #13 — final full-suite gate.
- [blocked] Merge/deploy: needs Tun bee's separate approval. Not doing it here.

Next authorized step after local gates: commit and open the PR; reviewer
decides merge. Then the icon upgrade ships with the normal release train.

# Current — Recipe Content Refresh V2 canonical source (2026-09-27)

**Status: `RECIPE_REFRESH_V2_CANONICAL_SOURCE_READY`. Remote systems:
`UNTOUCHED`.** Branch `codex/recipe-content-refresh-v2-canonical` starts from
`origin/main` `c81d6da2b3a9c051270b97953bfbb2c5aa34d057`; pushed implementation
checkpoint is `fc5e713e10e0b63c890ba31fc29d9678be896ed7`.

- [done] Audit ZIP hash
  `ebc18f06ee7fb4498f8cd2a7886f333a85b385f32af4407ae1b44b4ec3cc06fe`:
  500 recipes / 500 unique expected IDs, 4,938 steps, 6,766 ingredients, 15
  root schema variants, 1,102 source references, 289 numeric and 211 null
  nutrition profiles.
- [done] Normalize all 500 recipes to the strict canonical V2 schema under
  `data/recipe-refresh/v2`; preserve qualitative/process truth without making
  RuntimeRecipe quantities nullable or inventing measurements.
- [done] Reconcile 2,515 ingredient rows (505 existing, 1,642 new reviewed,
  368 aliases, 0 ambiguous/invalid); classify 166 process-only and 7
  mixed-process rows; project 3,770 rows and exclude 2,996 unsafe rows.
- [done] Re-audit nutrition: 353 candidates, 1 publishable, 288 blocked, 211
  truthful null. Salt beds, frying media, discarded/process liquids, and
  unresolved absorption are not counted as fully consumed.
- [done] Add deterministic `pnpm recipe:refresh:check`, strict parser,
  RuntimeRecipe projection, real catalog fingerprint, machine audit artifacts,
  targeted 11-test regression suite, ADR-032, and `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
- [done] Pin canonical artifact SHA-256
  `fc7eefe6573ee9de1083728db1f34b058954fa60ff478f7c5e41dce9e4570dbe`
  and runtime fingerprint
  `6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`.
- [done] Final local gates: refresh/import checks, typecheck, lint,
  `git diff --check`, focused 11/11, and `pnpm check` PASS; full Vitest 204
  files / 4,591 tests. Sparse-checkout initially omitted tracked `public/`;
  restoring that tracked directory fixed the unrelated CSP/PWA asset failures.
- [pending] Open PR, require hosted exact-head CI and independent review. Do
  not merge, deploy, create 0040, mutate D1/R2, change recipe authority, or
  enable T20 in this task.

Next authorized release task: generate the Content Refresh V2 manifest and
`0040_recipe_content_refresh_v2.sql` from this canonical package, then certify
staging before any production rollout.

# Historical takeover receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_CODE_COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository ID `1368281478` is `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`. Application PR #53 merged
normally at `03005fcbc39ab3c964393d2091f726088a4be5d0`; exact-head PR CI
`35810551334` and exact-main CI `35810986000` both PASS (189 files / 4,367 tests).
Integration reviewed head is `dbf32547a07fbc767e044365866a2bdfc4264cd8`; the
original recovery branch remains immutable at `0a04209e512d19293ed56a19d3fd51eb29ffefcd`.

Rechecked after the external merge: main remains `03005fc` and preserves the
exact recovered checkpoint. PR #54 carries this documentation-only handoff;
the application must not be reconstructed or republished as another PR.
Production D1 certification is blocked: this workspace has no Cloudflare API
token and `pnpm wrangler whoami` reports unauthenticated. Earlier takeover
evidence recorded missing GitHub verification secrets. Current repository and
Environment secret/variable listings return HTTP 403, so their present contents
cannot be independently verified here; Worker-side presence remains unverified.
Automatic staging run `35811338820` failed BEFORE deployment on the missing
staging verification secret; its production job was skipped. No deployment,
migration, secret change, rollout or rollback was performed.

See `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T19_V2_TAKEOVER_AUDIT.md` for evidence and operator
steps. Provision the release prerequisites, certify production read-only, then
use the reviewed rollout workflow and prove rollback. T19 is NOT complete;
T20 remains blocked. Earlier pending/publication-blocked claims below are
historical and superseded by this receipt.

**Current: T19_V2_APPLICATION_INTEGRATED_CI_PENDING.**

## T19 V2 — recipe authority cutover (integration 2026-09-22)

Repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako3/Frigo-dev`; current main is
`a3b1564`. The immutable original branch is published at expected head
`0a04209`, and application checkpoint `558be74` is integrated onto
`feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2-integration` from current main. PR #52 is
merged historical safe-stop documentation.

- [done] Focused authority/planner/release/shopping/cooking/inventory suite: 13
  files / 356 tests PASS; full Vitest 188 files / 4,333 tests PASS; D1 release
  certification 23/23 plus the 500-recipe/tip-0037/integrity fixture PASS; lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, 500-recipe import check and build PASS.
- [done] Final safety review: static planner identity excludes hidden D1-only
  families/ingredients/diagnostics; evidence requires Bearer auth; production
  transition preflight is monotonic and auto-restores the exact prior Worker on
  failed deployment proof.
- [done] Two review passes fixed: same-source authority drift, incomplete
  rollback proof, missing Cloudflare/D1 identity + catalog/integrity
  certification, fabricated canary readiness, unfenced D1 families, shadow
  promotion without D1 proof, backwards SHAs, cancellation bypassing rollback,
  unverified staging. Full Vitest 189 files / 4,364 PASS on the current tree.
- [blocked] Integration publication: push rejected — GitHub App credential
  lacks `workflows` permission. Branch commits `8205883` + `553791a` + docs
  are preserved locally with workspace-only bundle/patch artifacts. Owner
  push with a capable credential unblocks; then the application PR and
  exact-head hosted CI/review.
- [pending] Normal merge, exact-main certification, production identity/catalog
  checks, release-secret provisioning, staged rollout and rollback proof.
- [untouched] Production: no D1 query/migration, secret/config mutation, deploy,
  rollout or rollback. T20 is blocked until `T19_COMPLETE`.

Canonical handoff: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T19_V2_WIP_HANDOFF.md`.

- Exact repository/base/production: `1368281478`, `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`,
  `66627ffea890dad1cec4e31674449775a940c660`.
- Isolated branch `feat/t18e-otp-email-delivery-recovery` is pushed; Google
  Sign-In files and behavior are untouched.
- `SEND_EMAIL` and the operator-authorized `RESEND_API_KEY` secret are present;
  the supplied key authenticates. The operator completed DNS correction and
  Resend reports the domain plus all three sending records as verified. Current
  Cloudflare sender authority and primary failure category remain UNKNOWN.
- Provider recovery is hardened and tested: Workers Email -> Resend -> fail
  closed, sanitized categories/logs, production invalidation on every delivery
  failure, and honest readiness semantics.
- Focused 165/165 and full Vitest 185 files / 4238 tests PASS; lint, typecheck,
  migration smoke and build PASS. No migration, workflow or production change.
- Review-only PR #50 is OPEN; hosted validate `35685553412` passed on
  publication head `eec404a` and the PR was `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`. Require
  fresh exact-head CI after the final docs receipt; do not merge or deploy.
- Next: operator verifies the fixed sender in Cloudflare Email Service,
  supplies an authorized inbox, and runs
  controlled staging then separately authorized production delivery checks.
  Evidence: `docs/ai/T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md`.

**Previous: T18D_READY_FOR_REVIEW.**

- T18D implementation freeze: `d3ef61c`, from exact base `07ace57241f8270b2458610979c709bb69b9a65a`.
- Four original findings and **seven** additional scoped P2s fixed;
  independent review open P0/P1/P2 = **0/0/0**; two P3 observations deferred.
- 27-screen human-style review: **14 PASS / 13 PASS_WITH_NOTE / 0 FAIL**.
- Focused browser: **14/14 PASS in 42.8s**, strict axe clean. Final repository
  logs pass: **185 files / 4226 tests in 333.25s**.
- Settled full matrix: **349 PASS / 5 intentional skips / 0 FAIL**, 354 cases
  in 23.3m; all **84 T18D cases PASS**, strict axe violations **0** across 162
  canonical checks. Duplicate breakpoint project instances alone skipped.
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled.log` and
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled/`. The prior matrix stopped
  near case 158 on pre-settle scan-review opacity/receipt enable sampling;
  parent added a 350ms wait after async CTA enable, with no axe/token changes.
- Fresh style **39/0**, contrast **33/33**, lint/typecheck/diff checks PASS.
- Review-only [PR #49](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/49) OPEN;
  publication checkpoint `fe1b5d4` pushed; auto-fix enabled, auto-merge disabled.
- Next: hosted CI/review settlement. Initial `validate` IN_PROGRESS in run
  `35677663372` at 01:57 UTC; no unresolved threads then.
  No merge/deploy. VoiceOver/NVDA NOT PERFORMED.

## Historical T18C receipt

**Previous: T18C_READY_FOR_REVIEW**, application freeze `6f8f6f4`.

- [done] 27/27 source-backed direct comparisons at all six widths: **2 PASS /
  25 PASS_WITH_DOCUMENTED_DIFFERENCE**, zero unresolved P0/P1/P2.
- [done] Browser **379 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 390 unique cases**;
  162 canonical + 449 regression screenshot files, zero strict axe/overflow.
  Five outer-timeout cases recovered; prior failures retained, not hidden.
- [done] Final lint/typecheck/full Vitest (**184 files / 4222 tests**), migration
  smoke/build, style (**39/0**), contrast (**33/33**) and diff checks PASS on
  the final implementation. Protected business/backend boundaries unchanged.
- [done] Review-only [PR #48](https://github.com/vn-tako/Frigo-dev/pull/48)
  opened; CI/review auto-fix enabled, auto-merge disabled.
- [done] Hosted `validate` SUCCESS on `289d80a` (run `35578662531`); final
  readiness audit clear, no unresolved threads or new migration/configuration
  action. Style/contrast/diff rechecks PASS; no application changes.
- [pending] Owner merge permission after latest documentation-head CI stays
  green. Human VoiceOver/NVDA not performed; auto-merge disabled.
  No merge, deployment or T18D.

[evidence index](.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/EVIDENCE.md).

## Historical continuation checkpoints (superseded)

Final combined browser run: **378 passed / 11 intentional skips / 1 failed**.
Home 1024px/200%-text overflow was a real P2; rem-based wrapping replaces the
fixed two-column breakpoint. Original zoom gate plus explicit stacking check:
**12/12 focused PASS**. Complete post-correction browser/repository reruns next;
the failed run stays separate as `pre-zoom/`. No readiness/PR claim yet.

**Repository gates PASS on application freeze `b024b0d`: 184 files / 4222
tests**, lint/typecheck/migrations/build/diff, style 39/0 and contrast 33/33.
Final browser matrix and post-fix visual review are running; review-only PR next.

Explicit native target bounds passed the unchanged strict accessibility gate
and focused keyboard/Week flow: 14 PASS / 1 intentional project skip.

Review correction: removed no-op non-recipe Week title actions; unit red/green
and flag-off route test pass. Independent re-review is clear. Fresh full gates
and 390 browser cases replace the intentionally interrupted 384-case attempt.

Keyboard closure checkpoint: native row/shell/Week actions and shopping
checked-state semantics verified by 37 focused unit tests and 12+1 browser
passes. Full gates and the unfiltered 384-case browser run are underway;
failure history remains in the handoff. No merge/deploy/T18D.

All 27 identities have now been compared directly. Localized source-led fixes
passed targeted browser gates (43 + 18 + 1 passes; five intentional project
skips) and typecheck. Full final certification is next; see the current
[handoff](docs/ai/HANDOFF.md) for diagnostic failures and preserved evidence.

## T18C — final redesign certification — SAFE PAUSE (2026-09-21)

**STATUS: `T18C_PAUSED_SAFE`** — implementation halted by owner instruction.
- Branch `feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` from exact base
  `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32`; checkpoint A `ac4d90e` pushed

- Evidence-led semantic fixes applied; final rerun pending. Resume:
  [T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md](docs/ai/T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md). No merge or deployment.

## T18B — payment authority unification — `T18B_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- Final review P1 fixed from expected `0926222` on the same branch/PR: price
  table → new offers only; issued intent → immutable per-order authority;
  signed callback → persisted-order match; entitlement → valid persisted paid
  intent only. Operational 49000/499000 prices and all checkout fences retained.
  Focused **151/151** (65 server payment), full **183 files / 4217 PASS**, browser
  **48/48**, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff checks PASS. Exact commands,
  failures/recovery and new-head CI boundary are in the report. No migration,
  auth, inventory, OCR/planner or workflow change in this final fix.
- Repository `1368281478` / `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; exact base/main
  `13ff3f22082fc0601a81b90c96edded4741194ac`; branch
  `feat/t18b-payment-authority`; review-only PR #47 OPEN, auto-fix enabled and
  auto-merge disabled. No merge/deploy performed.
- Server-owned prices retained: monthly 49000 / annual 499000 VND; plan-only
  checkout, signed provider/QR contract, owned status and once-per-intent grants.
  Legacy secret grants retired; fresh same-owner `/me` confirms Plus.
- Pushed checkpoints `2aba91a`, `c00ea9f`, `1cef30b`, `1aabd32`; focused tests
  121/121, browser 48/48 plus error-state rerun 4/4, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/
  build PASS. First full run's single style failure was corrected in source;
  regression 38/38 and complete rerun **183 files / 4185 tests PASS**.
- Independent review: remaining P0/P1/P2/P3 all 0. Migrations 38/0 changes;
  T18A OTP, Inventory Truth, OCR/AI, recipe/planner/Week and Cloudflare infrastructure
  unchanged. No real payment. Live provider setup requires separate authorization.
- Readiness follow-up: CI `35554499704` passed at `2d6ff5a`; no review threads.
  Corrected deployed image CSP for VietQR and removed the obsolete payment-secret
  warning, without changing Wrangler bindings/workflows. Regression red/green,
  focused 104/104, browser 48/48 with production image policy, lint/typecheck/
  migration smoke/build/header parity/full-diff check PASS. New-head CI is
  verified separately on the PR before readiness; see the report for exact commands.
- Next: owner review/merge permission once final-head CI is green; no local blocker.

  `feat/t18a-auth-resend-expiry-contract`, review-only PR #46 OPEN; auto-fix
  CI/review subscription enabled. Not merged or deployed.
- Pushed server `88096cb7fbea8e3b95f5627ff5a46e8c3d34b462`, client

  `53f9fefdc9d935bb736a37cdcd9f5b0d0479685e` checkpoints.
- Resend now returns storage-authoritative `expiresInMinutes`; client no
  longer guesses. Reset policy remains generic; malformed/delivery/offline
  failures remain honest; security/T17B lifecycle invariants preserved.
- Final auth/security 300/300, full Vitest 180 files/4117 tests and six-viewport
  browser auth 42/42 PASS; lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff checks PASS.
  Chromium dependency repaired; initial full-suite timeout recovered with a
  passing extended full run (two workers, no filters).
- Payment/billing/production/migration behavior unchanged. Next: final-head
  hosted CI and human review, never merge/deploy from this task. No local blockers.

  HEAD `0f358f2`, certification checkpoint `00594eb`. Corrective checkpoints
  `8b0f050`, `9a94afb`, and `0f358f2` preserve all server-owned preference and
  verification state; `00594eb` measures registry layout after finite motion.
- Route-driven onboarding 04–06 exposes exactly seven cuisine and nine
  restriction choices (both include canonical `other`) while round-tripping
  authoritative values outside those chips, including `italian` and
  `vegetarian`. Authenticated completion waits for server confirmation; the
  preserved offline-guest path intentionally commits locally. Verification
  exit resets loading; server OTP/session authority and independent spicy-level
  truth remain intact.
- The current 27-screen registry uses reviewer-verified contracts. Focused auth
  is 102/102, verify/onboarding is 39/39, full Vitest is 180 files/4087, T13 is
  60/60, automated accessibility is 12/12 across six viewports, and the clean
  T17 matrix is 216 pass/6 intentional skips.
- Post-review fix `56fc01b`: screen 06 is a native `today`/`week`/`both` goal
  group (client-only, never sent to `/preferences`; `week` → `/week/setup`) and
  stored household size `6..20` round-trips unchanged. Reran: focused 87/87,
  Vitest 180 files/4094, registry 18/18, full T17 216/6/0, lint/typecheck/
  migrations/build/diff-check PASS.
- Residuals are 43/43 protected-payment allowlisted with 0 unjustified;
  contrast is 33/33. Worker/payment/migration diffs are zero.
- Visual source: `.hoplite/artifacts/t17-playwright/final-00594eb-clean/`;
  validated package: `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-final-visuals-00594eb.zip`
  (232 entries, 180 PNGs; SHA-256 `d6f6d4f032c0ac637ce5d1523ecc95b1411bc567538bca8d235a7131e6ad9d70`).
- Corrective documentation checks pass: whitespace, required markers,
  protected-boundary zero diffs, ZIP integrity, and all 180 JSON/TSV screenshot
  records and hashes. The first ad hoc validator expected the wrong command
  field; the corrected `generatingCommand` check found no artifact defect.
- Managed Preview was recovered from an inferred `pnpm dev` path that lacked the
  isolated API to `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`; tracked settings were
  restored unchanged. Exact remote checkpoint `f901b02` passed supported
  synthetic reset/login and screens 04–06 at 390x844 with no page errors.
- Replacement PR #45 opened against exact main `858759f` from `f901b02`; its
  auto-fix CI/review loop is enabled and PR #44 remains untouched. At publication
  head `1cacd0b`, hosted validate run `35532565549` passed, GitHub reported
  `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`, and reviews, review comments, conversation comments, and
  unresolved human feedback were empty. The final merge-readiness pass reran
  focused auth/onboarding/session tests 74/74, changed-file ESLint, typecheck,
  artifact integrity, protected-boundary checks, and whitespace checks.
- No T17B merge or staging/production deploy occurred. Once the
  documentation-only readiness checkpoint retains green/CLEAN exact-head
  provider status, the authorized user may decide whether to merge PR #45.
  Direct board comparison
  and NVDA/VoiceOver remain pending with no named assignee or tracking issue;
  `HUMAN_SCREEN_READER = NOT_EXECUTED`.
- `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED AUTH-CONTRACT BLOCKER`: registration reports a
  10-minute lifetime, but resend returns no fresh expiry metadata. A server/API
  owner must resolve that separately; the client honestly records unknown.
- `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED PAYMENT-AUTHORITY BLOCKER`: frontend/QR prices remain
  `599000`/`79000`, while payment-intent authority remains `499000`/`49000`;
  the VietQR amount comes from a frontend prop instead of the server intent.
  This requires a separate owner-authorized payment follow-up; T17B made no fix.

## Previous T17 — Takosan UI V2 certification pass, `T17_PARTIAL` (2026-09-19)

- [done] `/auth/verify` real route over the existing OTP state machine; tab-scoped code-free context; honest empty state; 14 regression tests.
- [done] 27 registered screens certified per width (`t17-registry.e2e.ts`).
- [done] Semantic-token migration: 991 sites; residual audit 43/43 allowlisted (payment UI only), 0 unjustified; zero emerald/transition-all/animate-in; arbitrary hex removed.
- [done] WCAG-AA: contrast 33/33 measured; axe 0 serious/critical on 25 surfaces; zoom re-enabled; h1/alt/44px/dialog semantics/OTP announcements verified.
- [done] Reduced-motion certification on auth, onboarding, sheet/dialog, cooking, planner, scan review.
- [done] Canonical `scan-review` + 8 more surfaces captured; state matrix evidenced; visual review fixes applied.
- [done] Gates at final HEAD recorded in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md` (lint, typecheck, vitest, migration smoke, build, T13 suite, six-width T17 matrix, greps, worker diff 0).
- [limit] Kit ZIP absent in sandbox: boards/`screens/*.md`/`SCREEN_REGISTRY` comparison outstanding; registry reconstructed in `tests/e2e/t17-ui/screen-registry.ts` with per-row source tags.
- [next] Holder of the ZIP: compare preserved captures against the three boards, diff `screen-registry.ts` vs `SCREEN_REGISTRY`; run a screen-reader walkthrough; then flip to `T17_COMPLETE`.
- [safety] `main` untouched; no merge; no deploy; production untouched; PayOS/worker zero-change.

## Current T16 — PWA cache and Google recovery deployed (2026-09-19)

- [done] Root cause: live `/auth` + `/sw.js` cache hits, wrong `_headers` worker path, fixed `takosan-pwa-v2` cache; clean Chromium proves real Google GIS works.
- [done] Release-SHA worker/cache, best-effort stale-client navigation after claim, correct no-store/immutable headers, Google numeric width + retry recovery, and exact-SHA deploy smoke implemented.
- [done] Independent review remediated; local Wrangler effective headers and two-release Chromium update PASS.
- [done] Full gates: **178 files / 4046 tests**, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, shell syntax, diff check.
- [limit] Reload/reopen/navigation is the reliable recovery boundary for legacy tabs that are closed, suspended, or blocked from running Service Worker code.
- [done] PR #42 / exact-head CI `35415335137`; merge main `6a016f1...`; exact-main CI `35415536459`; staging `35415763483`.
- [done] Production Deploy `35415843682`, Worker `2f228dc9-d97b-4eb1-8cff-9a0f2df3b51c`, D1 38/0038, recipe `shadow/0/false`.
- [done] Live exact-SHA readiness, no-store shell/worker, immutable assets, Google popup and exact-SHA Service Worker/cache verified.
- [next] Capture one manual real-inbox OTP receipt without exposing the code.

## Current T15C-D — production 1% Canary certification — safe stop (2026-09-19)

- [done] Canonical repo/main verified: `1368281478`, `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`, `347b536950cf54d25a2d6a880c3c2cb3d8c8f329`; PR #38/#39 merged.
- [done] Exact-main CI `35409762462` and staging Deploy `35409964105` passed; staging `static/0/false`, production skipped.
- [done] Full local baseline passed: seed/import, typecheck, lint, migration smoke through 0038, build, **178 files / 4044 tests**, diff check.
- [done] Production read-only public audit remains `shadow/0/false`, Worker `6c336889-680d-4cc3-b03b-1007849aa738`, 71 deterministic recipes, D1-only samples hidden.
- [blocked] No authorized operator-owned INCLUDE/EXCLUDE household pair was supplied; local Wrangler is unauthenticated. No customer enumeration and no production mutation.
- [status] `T15C_D_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_TEST_HOUSEHOLDS_UNAVAILABLE`; receipt `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_D_PRODUCTION_1PCT_CANARY_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- [done] PR #40 merged receipt commit `16958c6...` as `763d7e9...`; exact-main CI `35411093064` and staging Deploy `35411300235` passed (`static/0/false`, production skipped).
- [next] Privately provide both operator-owned household IDs and authenticated Cloudflare operator access; re-run direct D1 certification, provision only hashed cohort secrets, certify 1%, then rollback to `shadow/0/false`. Stop before 2%, 5%, full D1, media, or T14G.

## Current T15C-C — authorized canary test cohort mechanism (dormant) — 2026-09-19

- [done] `packages/recipes/src/recipe-canary-cohort.ts` + `src/worker/services/recipe-authority.ts`: server-side override for operator-owned test households — `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT_ENABLED` / `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_INCLUDE` / `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_EXCLUDE` (Worker secrets; SHA-256 digests of `recipe-catalog-test-cohort:<householdId>`, never raw IDs). Precedence exclude > include > deterministic FNV bucket; disabled by default; canary+cutover only; zero effect in static/shadow/d1 or without a tenant; every malformed/half-applied shape fails closed in canary mode (`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT` fatal; static + loud diagnostic at request time). **R1 remediation:** cohort variables are inert in static/shadow/d1 (rollback = single mode change, no secret cleanup — P1 resolved) and an active cohort requires BOTH an include and an exclude household (`TEST_COHORT_PAIR_REQUIRED` — P2 resolved). Request input cannot reach it. `fnv1a32`/`recipeCanaryBucket`/thresholds unchanged.
- [done] Tests: 25 unit + 4 HTTP (request-control attempts, guest, static/shadow) + workflow/wrangler/manifest guardrail; no migration, no workflow change.
- [status] `T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_READY` — NOT `T15C_CANARY_COMPLETE`. Production still `shadow / 0 / false`; no deploy/config/D1/R2 change. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT.md`. Previous safe stops (T15C-B, `T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`) remain valid history.
- [next] Operator supplies the two authorized households → digests as production secrets → T15C-B 1% canary through the protected workflow (separate authorization).
## Current T15C — production Canary safe stop (authorized cohort unavailable) — 2026-09-18

- [done] Fresh audit on canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e` (resolved by repository ID 1368281478): seed/import/typecheck/lint/check:migrations(0038)/build PASS; full `pnpm test` 176 files / 4008 tests PASS.
- [done] Read-only public production audit: readiness commit == main `b41aa468…`, database ok, 5/5 catalog reads = 71 deterministic, legacy IDs 200, D1-only IDs 404. Latest production Deploy receipt 35404106102 = `shadow / 0 / false` on that exact SHA (helper convergence 2 attempts).
- [stop] No operator-owned inside-1%/outside-1% production test cohort and no Cloudflare credentials in this environment; no customer IDs inspected; no dispatch/approval/D1/R2/config change. Classification `T15C_CANARY_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`.
- [next] Operator provides both authorized cohorts + read-only CF credentials + Environment reviewer; resume at exactly 1% via the protected `deploy.yml`; no widening beyond the 1→2→5 ladder, no `d1`, no media/R2, no T14G.

## Current T15B-SHADOW — production Shadow certified; stop before canary — 2026-09-18

- [done] PR #30 merged as `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`; exact-main CI `35336548833` and automatic staging Deploy `35336830786` succeeded. Staging stayed STATIC71 on Worker `580acb76-a006-4c0a-b991-618ebde07e88`.
- [done] Production Shadow Deploy `35337110268` succeeded after the required Environment approval: Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`, exact SHA, convergence 1 attempt / 574 ms.
- [done] Independent live checks: 5/5 catalog reads returned 71, legacy IDs returned 200, five D1-only IDs returned 404; Shadow tail showed D1 500/500 hydrated, release READY, zero drift/errors, no authority leak.
- [done] D1 stayed tip 0037 / ledger 37 / release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`; no migration or other D1 write. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15B_SHADOW_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- [stop] `T15B_SHADOW_COMPLETE`; no canary, full D1, cutover, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS/auth, or stale PR #29 merge.

## Previous T15B-PRE checkpoint — STATIC certified; SHADOW wiring PR ready — superseded 2026-09-18

- [done] Canonical repository `1368281478` / `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`, main `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf`; PR #29 remained open and unmerged.
- [done] Immutable production D1 receipt `35329772751`: tip 0037, 500 recipes, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, schema gate PASS, FK `[]`, quick check `ok`, 500 pending media rows / 0 ready.
- [done] Static Deploy `35333517052` approved and SUCCESS: Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052`, exact SHA convergence PASS, five repeated live checks served 71 static recipes.
- [done] Rollback evidence: previous Worker `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439`; rollback mode `RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE=static`.
- [ready for review] PR #30 (`codex/t15b-shadow-wiring`) adds only validated `static|shadow` workflow plumbing and tests; implementation head `97aff50d…` exact CI `35335079345` SUCCESS. Final docs head must also have exact-head CI SUCCESS. Do not merge or activate in this task.
- [not started] Shadow activation/certification, canary, full D1, media/R2, T14G; Inventory Truth/T09/T11 unchanged.

## Current T15A — pre-production rollout hardening COMPLETE (production rollout not started) — 2026-09-18

- [done] PR #26 merged (`70cf7e0d…`): schema gate derived from `migrations/`, pinned migration chain, `catalog` certification command.
- [done, PR #27 / T15A-R2, pushed] `wait-for-deployed-release.mjs` bounded exact-SHA convergence helper; `readiness.commit` must be a canonical 40-hex SHA (malformed/missing → fail closed, only a different *valid* SHA retries; regression tests A–J).
- [done, PR #27 merged → main `0fe2cf07…`] Workflow wiring (`catalog` step in `production-d1-migrate.yml` after `verify`/before the schema gate, input interpolation removed, staging+production deploy proof via the helper) and unconditional guardrail tests are committed on the PR branch (`366dbd1`, `776422f`; identical to `t15a-r/workflows.patch` / `r2-wired-series.mbox`, retained as audit evidence). Focused 123/0 skipped; hosted exact-head CI SUCCESS. Merged by maintainer (merge commit); exact-main push CI 35329100767 SUCCESS; automatic Deploy 35329500028: release+staging SUCCESS, staging exact-SHA convergence via the helper (attempt 1, 547 ms), production SKIPPED. Classification `T15A_PRE_PRODUCTION_HARDENING_COMPLETE`.
- [next] T15A Phase B (live production re-query → migrate 0035–0037 via `production-d1-migrate.yml` → static deploy → shadow) only with credentials + operator approval; historical last verified production tip = 0034 (must be re-queried live first). No canary/d1/media/T14G. P3_FUTURE_MEDIA_GATE_COMPATIBILITY: `catalog` requires `media_ready=0`; revisit before any migration after media population.
- [next] T15A Phase B (live production re-query → migrate 0035–0037 via workflow → static deploy → shadow) only with credentials + operator approval; historical last verified production tip = 0034 (must be re-queried live first). No canary/d1/media/T14G. P3_FUTURE_MEDIA_GATE_COMPATIBILITY: `catalog` requires `media_ready=0`; revisit before any migration after media population.

## Historical T14F — T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE (T14F-A/B/C certified; production untouched) — 2026-09-17

- T14F-C completed and committed (on top of authorized base `7d667523…`): 0037 promoted byte-identical (`68e52e6d…`), shipped manifest regenerated to 500/2 batches (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, `fa47d31f…`), replay (fresh 0001→0037, 0036→0037, 0034→…→0037) PASS, D1 readiness READY 500, static/shadow/canary/full-D1 PASS, user flows incl. Batch B cuisines PASS. Development certificate: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_C_500_CATALOG_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- **T14F-C CLOSED**: safe stop `44c0ad38…` resolved. Full closure gates PASS — lint, build, full `pnpm test` **171 files / 3913 tests**, typecheck, migration smoke through 0037, seed/import checks (500/2), diff check. One real blocker fixed forward-only in `8c6080aa…` (tests only): the five real-D1 suites overflowed workerd 1.20250718's 1 MiB statement cache when replaying 0001→0037 in one process (cloudflare/workerd#5977); `tests/helpers/local-d1-worker.mjs` recycles workerd before that. No migration/catalog/runtime change. Second blocker (docs heads): hosted Vitest passed 171/3913 but exited 1 on a vitest-worker `onTaskUpdate` RPC timeout — fixed forward-only via `tests/helpers/vitest-event-loop-yield.ts` (setupFiles; test config only).
- Final head + hosted exact-head validate SUCCESS bound in the PR #25 final certification receipt. Classification: `T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE` · `T14F_REAL_CATALOG_500_COMPLETE` · `T14F_500_AUTHORITY_CERTIFIED` · `PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_DEFERRED` · `MEDIA_POPULATION_DEFERRED` · `T14G_NOT_STARTED`; P3 = 1 (~780 KB unpaginated `/recipes`, T14G).
- PR #25 **ready for review, unmerged**. Production does **not** contain 500 recipes. Merge, production rollout, media population and T14G each need separate authorization.

## Historical T14F — T14F_B_SCALE_BATCH_CERTIFIED — 2026-09-17

- T14F-A pilot certified (`b0150d0…`). T14F-B scale batch completed: **399/399 records** (`t14f-scale-399-v1`) validated publishable, 0 hard duplicates, 0 unresolved ingredients; QA `ok` 0 findings; double compile byte-identical; candidate-500 composition proven (500 unique, order verified).
- Shipped release was 101 (`rel-193ac2b16c64a260`) at the time; approved-batches/current manifest unchanged then; 0036 SHA-256 unchanged; 0037 not yet created; no production action.
- Full gates PASS (171 files / 3911 tests, 2026-09-17). Certified head in PR #25 receipt / `T14F_B_SCALE_BATCH_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- Next: T14F-C only with separate authorization (0037 + 500 manifest). PR #25 stays draft/unmerged.

- Repository ID 1368281478; unchanged main; forward-only `hoplite/massalia-c2862d7c`;
  PR #25 draft/unmerged. Inherited routing fix `8079a37`, verification commit `2ee6f5cc…`.
- Original 5/7 failure independently reproduced: strict 71/101 COUNT_DRIFT is correct.
  Generated test-local 71 release now proves real D1/canary, null fallback, `[5]`/`[]` cache,
  invalid-drift rejection and cleanup; no runtime, pilot, manifest or migration change.
- Routing 8/8, growth 21/21, combined 29/29 twice, non-isolated 29/29, subsystem 383/383 PASS.
  Executed seed/import/typecheck/lint/migration smoke/build/test/diff: all PASS;
  full suite **171 files / 3911 tests**. Exact implementation CI **35223589293 / 105209475052 SUCCESS**.
- Final documentation SHA + hosted CI SUCCESS are bound in the [certification receipt](https://github.com/frigo-4/Frigo-dev/pull/25#issuecomment-5714709031).
  That final certified SHA, not the implementation commit, is the only valid future T14F-B base.
- Pilot 30 + legacy 71 = 101, complete 101/order 0..100, five statements/no N+1;
  replay, authority modes, imported HTTP flows and Inventory Truth regressions PASS.
- **STOP.** Await separately authorized T14F-B. No ingredient scale preflight, Batch B, 0037,
  500 manifest, production/media/T14G action or merge. Overall T14F is not complete.
- Exact commands/hashes: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`. Local-only settings preserved.

## Historical T14F — WIP SAFE STOP — 2026-09-17 (superseded by takeover above)

- Pilot batch `t14f-pilot-30-v1`: 30 original recipes authored + reviewed + compiled via T14E (30/30
  publishable, 0 duplicates, 0 unresolved ingredients); `0036_recipe_catalog_pilot.sql` promoted
  byte-identical; manifest `rel-193ac2b16c64a260` 101 recipes / 1 batch; `ALL_RECIPES` still 71.
- Checks: typecheck, `check:migrations`, seed check, import check, diff check PASS; focused growth
  suites 20/21 — `production forward path 0034 → 0035 → growth` fails when both growth suites run
  together, passes alone (root cause unknown). Lint/build/full tests/bundle NOT run. Batch B not started.
- Full state and exact next steps: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_WIP_HANDOFF.md`.

  in GitHub staging env; Deploy run 35073197948 failed there). Production app unchanged.
- T14C not started. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14B_B_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.

## T14B-B — MERGED TO MAIN 2026-09-16; PRODUCTION ROLLOUT BLOCKED (OPS SECRET)

## T14B-B — D1 CATALOG PARITY & SHADOW FOUNDATION — 2026-09-16 (merged; details)

- Migration `0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql`: 12 global recipes persisted, D1 = 71
  complete, `recipe_runtime_fields` (persisted `runtime_order`, typed open `category`, closed
  `region`, legacy nutrition) + `recipe_runtime_ingredient_order` added; `0001–0033` unchanged
  (fixed hash manifest).
- D1 → `RuntimeRecipe` hydration is lossless and order-preserving for all 71; recommendation,
  tie-sensitive ranking, planner (incl. tie fixture), >5-alternative swap and cooking parity
  proved on the actual D1 catalog output. **`ALL_RECIPES` remains production authority**; shadow
  mode is opt-in and production-rejected. Media → T14C; cutover → T14D; bulk import → T14E.
- Gates: lint, typecheck, build, `migration-smoke=ok`, seed check, full Vitest (totals in
  `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14B_B_REMEDIATION_HANDOFF.md` §10); PR #14 not merged.

# Historical boards — superseded by the current refresh above

## CANONICAL REPOSITORY CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE — 2026-09-15

- `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`) is now the canonical long-term
  repository. PR #2 merged reviewed head `7ede92c` into `main` as merge commit
  `a5cfb14cfd5840be23eb16b26a3689f5e2d6e805`.
- Merge tree equals the reviewed tree; application freeze `5f6853d`, production
  `05423f2`, Qwen `da41686`, T13 `32ddbb4`, and Takosan `ff63edf` remain
  ancestors of canonical main.
- PR CI `34972891435` and post-merge CI `34973522150` passed. Strict `validate`,
  force-push/deletion blocks, and admin enforcement remain active.
- No staging or production deployment occurred. Production migration/D1/KV/R2/
  queue/PayOS/DNS/T14 work remains blocked and out of scope.

## T13R CERTIFIED — 2026-09-14

- **T13 REMEDIATION CERTIFIED — READY FOR INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW #2.**
  `T13R_APPLICATION_FREEZE=32ddbb4f2bb636fdcf201e9ca99c4689d3655477` on
  `hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04` (repo ID 1368281478; main `d1b06732…` unchanged).

  T13R-B 171/7, real local D1 92/5, browser 60/60 (360/390/430), 32 migrations
  (0031/0032 unchanged, 0033 absent), fresh + legacy real D1 replay, schema gate,
  writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0, diff-check, detached porcelain EMPTY. No hosted CI for
  the exact freeze. P0/P1/blocking P2 = 0/0/0; AC1–AC14 PASS; roadmap rows DONE.
- Next and only step: INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW #2. See
  `docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13R_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md`.

## SAFE STOP — T13R-B — 2026-09-13T21:35Z

- P2-1 FIXED (commit `4d587eb`), P2-4/P2-5/P2-6 FIXED in WIP `7e68e3b`
  (unit + integration + 12/12 t13r-b-presentation browser cases GREEN at
  360/390/430; full Playwright suite 51 passed; typecheck PASS).
- Certification (full Vitest, build, migrations, D1, authority audit,
  freeze) NOT started. Next: resume certification per
  `docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13R_B_REMEDIATION.md`.
## Production rollout receipt — 2026-09-15

- Production D1 `frigo-db`: migrations `0001`-`0033`, remote schema gate PASS.
- Deployed compatibility SHA `64ee9ed1`; deployed canonical SHA
  `e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786`.
- Readiness exact-SHA PASS; DB/queue/AI/config healthy, PLUS-grant warning only.
- Full Vitest `3630/3630`, lint/typecheck/build and frozen install PASS.
- Follow-up blocked on hosted CI/review for open PR #4; no protection bypass.
## T18C continuation checkpoint — 2026-09-21

**T18C_PARTIAL** — resumed existing branch at `2e770f8`, exact base `b8447e85`,
repository `1368281478` / `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; upstream corrected. Fresh
pause-tree matrix **6 passed / 162 screenshots / 162 axe audits / zero
violations and overflow**. Approved source ZIP is now available and direct
comparison is underway: [provenance](docs/ai/T18C_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md).
Final source-led fixes, regressions, full gates and PR remain pending.
Original baseline and workspace settings preserved; no merge/deploy/T18D.

## 2026-10-12 payOS production recovery and Plus shell consistency

Scope: explicit owner authorization to finish payOS production integration and fix
related failures, including the reported home/Plus navigation mismatch.

- Verified active production is safe rollback source 4fb7c40, checkout OFF; staging
  serves 186a9cf with checkout ON. Existing channel secrets and webhook registration
  remain provisioned separately; no bank transfer or fabricated settlement.
- Corrected durable admission to accept the same bounded ASCII alphanumeric virtual
  bank accounts as the signed payOS adapter; real-SQLite create/replay/resume regression.
- Candidate download follows immutable artifact ID from the producer, including
  failed-only reruns; missing IDs fail closed, no name/attempt guessing.
- Added bounded recovery only for proven Wrangler 4.149.0 GET service/secrets
  metadata transient failures before any mutation. Every restart rechecks current
  main, exact-SHA hosted CI and release policy. Ambiguous upload/timeout stays failed
  and uses the existing verified rollback path. Only sanitized evidence is retained.
- Public smoke proves both ordinary and revalidated native-curl /sw.js profiles,
  three consecutive full SHA and matching byte hashes. Only a structurally valid
  prior canonical SHA waits, within 90 seconds; invalid assets still fail closed.
- Source cause of UI mismatch: /plus omitted from AppLayout kitchen allowlist; same
  defect exists in both current main and rollback code. Migrated guest/account Plus
  to shared header, top scan and five-item navigation. Regression enumerates every
  actual route; immersive scan/cook stays fullscreen.
- Executed so far: 153 payment tests, 176 UI tests, 313 release/flags/retry tests PASS;
  lint, both TypeScript checks, executable billing contract, 41 migration replay and
  paired planner/T20 build PASS. Full suite and protected rollout pending.
- Next: PR review and exact-SHA hosted CI, staging proof, required production reviewer
  approval, production identity/assets/authority proof, then checkout activation and
  authenticated application QR. Paid entitlement acceptance needs the owner's bank
  transfer. Do not describe pending production as complete.
- Final pre-PR review: case/slash route variants align with Router; 245 UI and 48
  retry/process tests PASS. First full local run 7,822 PASS/12 failures; stale Plus
  exclusion fixed and the 11 existing macOS tmp-path fixture failures all pass under
  canonical TMPDIR (93 tests). A final full canonical run and hosted CI remain pending.

## Admin release adapter follow-up (2026-10-17)

The evidence-only checkpoint is 77f81b7bff1c29790a67ea48475aa720a86b9f2e.
It preserves full local runtime evidence on 066c35ad670bc877756150c2055e3844dd7a17ce.
A separate default-disabled release adapter now implements signed, expiry/run/source/
policy/migration-bound operations, live target/source/protection checks, durable
pre-action artifacts, fixed Admin-only migration/bootstrap/recovery paths and
disabled deploy/rollback with compensation attempts. Four manual workflows use
protected dedicated Admin environments and no credential in plan mode.
52 adapter/provider tests passed during development; new exact-SHA full validation
and independent source review are still mandatory. Initial development fixture
key destructuring failed four tests and was fixed before the passing run.
No Cloudflare or production operation occurred. Real identities/protections,
independent human custody, initial resource/enrollment setup, first safe rollback
baseline, live API staging rehearsal and explicit owner authorization remain
blocked. Existing evidence is not relabeled as a test of the adapter.

## Admin adapter containment follow-up (2026-10-17)

- Implemented narrow signed shutdown without D1/facade/secrets/build dependence.
- Added dedicated manual containment lane, strict smoke markers, full account
  route inventory, staging artifact authority, and restore-from-shutdown checks.
- Pending next frozen SHA full verification and independent review; retain all
  old evidence under its original SHA. Staging and production remain blocked.

Admin final source `9395f0e31ea599f1eb7780a8eba36964fed7c483`: all 15 exact-source local verification commands exit 0;
independent release review is retained in docs/admin/production-readiness/13_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md.
Next: restore GitHub access/protections and obtain explicit real staging/resource/operator authorization.
Status remains ADMIN_V1_PRODUCTION_READINESS_BLOCKED / ADMIN_V1_STAGING_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED.

Validation qualification: default-concurrency full suite on 9395f0e3 failed 10 timing checks; full serial rerun uses existing assertions/timeouts. Both attempts are retained in production-readiness evidence and raw output archive; see 12_REGRESSION_RESULTS.md for actual results. Hosted default-concurrency CI remains required.

## Admin production takeover — 2026-10-18

- [x] Adopt owner decision: one enrolled SUPER_ADMIN / one owner signature; protect the last owner.
- [x] Add schema 4 governance migration preserving history and revoking sessions.
- [x] Add audited owner enrollment, disabled initialization, guarded enablement and exact rollback/containment.
- [x] Add offline owner signing utility and sanitized read-only Cloudflare metadata audit workflow.
- [x] Run local focused governance/release tests, lint, typecheck, build, migration smoke and public scan.
- [x] Publish branch through normal PR #15.
- [ ] Require exact-head `validate` + `validate-admin` and configured human review before merge.
- [ ] Observe dedicated Admin resources/Access app and create protected admin Environments.
- [ ] Execute staging ST01-ST20, then production release only after exact-SHA evidence and Environment approval.

Live Admin deployment and remote authority mutation remain pending external evidence.

## Admin credential checkpoint - 2026-10-18 11:44 UTC

- [x] Store the owner-created Cloudflare token in both dedicated Admin Environment secrets and verify metadata.
- [x] Run GET-only local audit with the new credential: all seven sections observed; exact Access apps/audiences/issuer matched.
- [ ] Complete PR #16 review and exact-head/main CI; run protected credential audit.
- [ ] Provision GitHub metadata token, reviewed owner public key and verified actual Access subject.
- [ ] Execute signed protected staging sequence and real acceptance before production.

Evidence: docs/admin/production-readiness/23_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_RECEIPT.md.
No runtime deployment occurred; release policy remains disabled.

## Owner signing preparation - 2026-10-18

- [x] Generate owner-requested Ed25519 key outside Git with restrictive file modes.
- [x] Verify cryptographic restoration from a local recovery copy.
- [x] Propose only the public key in both disabled release-policy targets.
- [ ] Obtain independent review of the final PR #16 head and exact-source hosted checks.
- [ ] Obtain independent offline backup, actual Access subject and GitHub read token.
- [ ] Run protected audit and staging operations/acceptance before production.

New key is proposed, not enrolled; custody remains PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.

Owner-key proposal checks PASS: 92 focused tests, lint, both TypeScript checks,
disabled-policy/key contract, public scan and diff check. pnpm audit snapshot
reports zero vulnerabilities; this does not close the separate Dependabot view.

## Admin release checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

- [x] Merge PR #22 at exact main `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`.
- [x] Exact-main CI `39289222795` and Admin CI `39289223049` PASS.
- [x] Protected rollback-disabled staging `39292571221` PASS; receipt and artifact digests verified.
- [x] Protected staging deploy-disabled `39293405049` PASS; console OFF and paired versions recorded.
- [x] Protected staging enable `39294320059` PASS; anonymous boundary 12/12 PASS.
- [ ] Complete authenticated ST01-ST20 exact-source evidence; Mac lock prevented new owner dashboard smoke.
- [ ] Produce signed staging certificate only after every ST row is PASS.
- [ ] Run production sequence only after the protected staging certificate is accepted.

Production Admin has not been mutated. Missing live identity, role, CSRF, recovery,
axe/load and customer regression evidence remains `PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`.

## Admin continuation checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

- [x] Resume authenticated owner smoke on exact SHA `0307fc10`: overview, users, AI/OCR, recipes, system, audit, settings, `/me`, save preference, logout and post-logout `/me` denial.
- [x] Complete exact-source emergency OFF `39331453601`, paired rollback `39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066`; all protected runs PASS with reviewer approval and artifact digests verified.
- [x] Recheck anonymous boundary 12/12 and customer health `takolio.app`/`api.takolio.app` HTTP 200/status ok after restore.
- [ ] Produce signed staging certificate: blocked by ST03-ST07, ST09, ST12, ST15 pending external evidence and partial ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19.
- [ ] Dispatch Admin production sequence: blocked until the exact-source all-PASS staging certificate exists; production remains untouched.

## Production dispatch recheck - 2026-10-20 10:31 UTC

The requested production deployment was rechecked against exact main
`0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`. Read-only checks passed for branch
protection, exact-main CI references, production Environment reviewer policy and
the existing production plan artifact. Workflow `39333366228` remains
`plan=success` with `execute=skipped`; no production Admin mutation occurred.

The protected release adapter still requires an owner-signed
`ADMIN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION` whose exact-source report has all ST01-ST20 set
to `PASS`. The current unsigned evidence remains 6 PASS, 6 PARTIAL and 8
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`; the certification secret is absent from the
production Environment. Therefore no execute dispatch was attempted, because it
would fail closed before Cloudflare credentials or production mutation.

Checks executed: `gh run view 39333366228`, production Environment policy and
secret inventory readback, `git diff --check`, and
`python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` (PASS). Next action remains obtaining
real missing staging evidence, signing the exact-source certificate, then
running the protected production commissioning sequence.

## Owner session closure - 2026-10-20

The latest owner-authenticated staging session was explicitly logged out and
returned to `/admin/login`. A follow-up navigation to
`/api/v1/admin/me` redirected to the Cloudflare Access sign-in page, confirming
that the session no longer had an authenticated Admin response. No token,
cookie or credential value was copied into evidence or chat. This closes the
browser-session limitation only; it does not close the remaining live ST03-ST19
evidence or create a staging certificate.

## QA identity lifecycle - 2026-10-20

- [x] Add reviewed staging-only `enroll-staging-test` / `revoke-staging-test` ceremony with owner signature, exact run/SHA binding, audit and production rejection.
- [x] Add additive append-only QA ceremony migration; no passwords, recovery keys, direct role grant or customer D1 access.
- [x] Add focused unit/integration coverage for alias ownership, replay, duplicate, five-identity limit, audit atomicity, session/role cleanup and last-owner protection.
- [x] Run 25/25 migration matrix, schema smoke, typecheck, Admin build, public scan and targeted Admin JSON suite.
- [ ] Obtain action-time approval to save five owner-controlled aliases in staging Access; do not alter production policy.
- [ ] Capture real Access issuer/subject for each alias, run protected staging ceremonies and role matrix, revoke all QA identities, then certify ST01-ST20.
- [ ] Review/merge exact source through normal branch protection before any workflow execution; production remains untouched.

## Staging QA policy and compatibility continuation - 2026-10-20

- [x] Save the owner-confirmed staging Access policy with exactly five `+takolio-qa-*` aliases; production policy unchanged.
- [x] Re-run schema-4 compatibility checks: focused tests 219/219, migration matrix 25/25, workerd 10/10, schema smoke, typecheck, Admin build, lint, public scan and diff check.
- [ ] Push the compatibility commit, wait for fresh PR #23 CI, and obtain independent review on the new HEAD.
- [ ] Capture real Access subjects and complete protected staging QA ceremonies and ST01-ST20 certification.
- [ ] Dispatch production only after a signed exact-source all-PASS staging certificate.
