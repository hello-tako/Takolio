# Latest production request checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `PRODUCTION_NOT_DEPLOYED_STAGING_CERTIFICATE_MISSING`.
Release source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; main and Admin CI PASS.
This current checkpoint supersedes the historical checkpoints retained below.

Production run `39333366228` is plan-only: plan SUCCESS, execute SKIPPED.
No production Admin mutation or new execute dispatch was performed. The
`admin-production` Environment has its release credentials but no
`ADMIN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION` or current run-bound release authorization.
The adapter requires a signed exact-source ST01-ST20 all-PASS certificate for
all production operations except emergency disable. Current evidence is
unsigned and incomplete: 6 PASS, 6 PARTIAL, 8 PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.
The missing separate Access test identity remains an external prerequisite;
the owner's existing deploy and Environment-approval authorization is retained.

Read-only recheck: main SHA, CI/run job states, Environment protection rules,
secret names and artifact metadata verified. The production Admin hostname
was not resolvable from this machine; customer web/API health returned HTTP
200. This hostname observation is not a substitute for a Cloudflare inventory.
The latest owner staging session was logged out; a subsequent `/me` navigation
returned the Cloudflare Access sign-in page. The previous Mac-lock/logout
uncertainty is resolved. Screenshot: ignored local
`.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/logout-confirmed-20261020.png`.

Checks: `git diff --check` and `python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` PASS.
No source, gate, protection, customer database, payment, OTP or AI API change.
Next: complete actual missing staging evidence, package/sign the protected
exact-source certificate, then perform protected production commissioning.
A gate change would need an explicit reviewed release-policy change; this
request did not fabricate PASS or silently remove the certificate gate.

# Current Admin staging checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_OWNER_SMOKE_ROLLBACK_PASS_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`.
Exact source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; exact-main CI
`39289222795` and Admin CI `39289223049` remain PASS. No runtime, customer,
payment, OTP or AI-provider code changed in this continuation.

Fresh protected staging evidence remains PASS: emergency disable
`39331453601`, paired rollback `39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066`, all
approved by `vn-taphoanhatung` with run-bound signatures and verified artifacts.
Owner SSO smoke resumed on the exact source and a logout event was verified.
A later login was opened for more GET coverage; macOS locked during logout, so
the latest session logout remains UNCONFIRMED. See latest browser limitation.

Additional read-only evidence under ignored `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/`:

- `api-read-scan-0307fc10.json`: six owner-authenticated GET payloads (`me`,
  users, overview, settings, audit, sessions) scanned; no forbidden credential
  field names found. The session-bound CSRF field is expected. This is payload
  evidence only and does not close every ST13 path.
- `boundary-extended-valid-preflight.json`: 60 anonymous/forged-header edge
  checks PASS. GET/POST redirect to the exact Access tenant; valid hostile-origin
  OPTIONS preflight returns the exact Cloudflare 403 denial body with no CORS
  headers. These are edge checks, not authenticated Worker CSRF/RBAC evidence.
  The original malformed OPTIONS probe omitted Access-Control-Request-Method,
  returned HTTP 400 and remains a retained failed harness. Its intermediate
  status-only reinterpretation is superseded and not acceptance evidence.
- `owner-final-logout-recheck.png`: an earlier verified logout at `/admin/login`;
  a subsequent session logout is unconfirmed because macOS locked.

Focused validation: release/provider/auth/concurrency tests `213/213` PASS;
T21RC2 capture files `93/93` PASS with `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`; Admin build and
both TypeScript checks PASS. Lint exits 0 with two warnings in generated ignored
bundles. Public scan and diff check PASS. An inadvertently unscoped full-suite
run reported 11 failures in two macOS temp-path/identity-fixture tooling files
(9105 tests passed); all 93 tests in those files passed on the focused corrected
temp-directory run. The failed full run is not reported as all-suite PASS.

The exact staging certification gate still has only 6 PASS (ST01/ST02/ST11/ST14/
ST17/ST20), 6 PARTIAL (ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19), and 8
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE` (ST03-ST07/ST09/ST12/ST15). Missing evidence includes
validly signed foreign/expired JWTs at the live Worker, an actual separate Access
identity and role matrix, authenticated negative CSRF, internal facade negatives,
concurrency/key recovery, complete audit/action matrix, real-host axe/load/JWKS
and full customer regression. No all-PASS report or certificate was signed.

Production plan-only run `39333366228` remains SUCCESS with execute SKIPPED,
artifact `12224599448` (archive SHA256
`0a75a03d8db02fcaf22a6363eb783360bee0e63e483789efbbe87c60f2d76713`).
`productionMutationExecuted=false`; production Admin remains untouched.
Next: complete the missing real staging evidence, package the protected exact-SHA
certificate, then perform the signed production commissioning sequence. Existing
owner authorization for deployment and Environment approvals remains valid;
this blocker is evidence, not a new permission request.

## Latest browser limitation

After the successful logout screenshot below, the owner session was opened once
more to continue the remaining GET coverage. The Mac then locked during the
logout attempt. The new session's logout is UNCONFIRMED; the earlier screenshot
proves its own completed logout event only, not the final current session state.
Do not reuse that image as proof that the latest session is logged out. No
browser lock bypass was attempted. Native Chrome access must resume on an
unlocked Mac for further authenticated acceptance work.

# Current Admin staging checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_OWNER_SMOKE_ROLLBACK_PASS_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`.
Exact source: `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; protected main and
exact-main CI `39289222795` / Admin CI `39289223049` remain unchanged and PASS.
This header supersedes the historical checkpoints retained below.

Owner Access login, dashboard/users/AI/recipes/system/audit/settings reads,
preference save, `/me`, logout and post-logout `/me` rejection completed on this
source. Authenticated users JSON contained 21 rows and no forbidden credential
fields; this is one payload path, not full ST13 certification. Credentials and
private data remain outside Git.

Fresh protected staging emergency disable `39331453601`, paired rollback
`39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066` all PASS with run-bound owner
signatures, actual `vn-taphoanhatung` Environment approvals and verified artifact
digests. Full source-specific ST20 now PASS. Current enabled Admin version:
`e7ed80bd-26cb-4e33-a658-0cf298412af0`; facade:
`4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`. Disabled baseline Admin:
`e38bfb72-8614-4b9f-b3e3-ef3fdf0824eb`, same facade. Anonymous boundary curl
checks PASS 12/12; customer `takolio.app` and `api.takolio.app` health 200/ok.

Current required matrix: 6 PASS (ST01/ST02/ST11/ST14/ST17/ST20), 6 PARTIAL
(ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19), 8 `PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`
(ST03-ST07/ST09/ST12/ST15). Missing actual foreign/expired token, other identity/
role, negative CSRF/facade, concurrency/recovery, full API exclusion, real-host
axe/load/JWKS and full customer regression evidence still prevents certification.
No all-PASS report or certificate was signed. Production plan-only `39333366228`
PASS with execute SKIPPED; no production Admin mutation/deployment occurred.

The Chrome extension still lacks its automation connection; native Chrome was
used through the documented UI API. Initial owner continuation failed under a
stale Access session; ordinary Cloudflare SSO sign-in restored it without OTP.
Initial Python urllib probes returned Cloudflare browser-integrity error 1010;
that failed harness report remains separate from successful curl boundary and
health evidence. An incorrect early `/api/health` path and Access-protected
customer staging health were not treated as runtime outage or successful health.
Preserve earlier release FAIL/UNKNOWN receipts and the checkpoint stash.

Latest ignored evidence: `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/resumed/`.
`git diff --check` and `python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` PASS. Only operational
documentation changed; no runtime code, customer data/schema, payment, OTP or AI
provider change was performed. Next: complete remaining live evidence, then the
protected exact-source staging certificate and production sequence. The owner
already delegated Environment approvals; no renewed deployment permission is
needed for the authorized scope.

# Current Admin staging release status - 2026-10-20 JST

Status: `ADMIN_STAGING_ENABLED_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED_LIVE_EVIDENCE`.
Exact source `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa` is merged through PR #22;
exact-main CI `39289222795` and Admin CI `39289223049` both PASS.
Fresh protected staging rollback `39292571221`, deploy-disabled `39293405049`,
and enable `39294320059` all PASS. Authorization, pre-action and receipt digests
were independently matched to the actual successful run and reviewer approval.

The verified disabled baseline at this SHA is Admin
`e38bfb72-8614-4b9f-b3e3-ef3fdf0824eb` / facade
`4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`. Current enabled staging Admin version is
`22c714f5-b281-4f9c-8a90-78292df78db4` with that same facade. Post-enable
anonymous Access denial checks PASS 12/12; customer health is HTTP 200/status=ok.

Production Admin has not been deployed or mutated. The corrected rollback
component passed, but a full emergency-OFF/paired-rollback cycle on this exact
new source has not run; do not mark complete ST20 or the entire ST01-ST20 matrix
PASS. Actual new-source owner dashboard/API/logout smoke was interrupted by
macOS locking; Chrome extension authentication was also unavailable. The user
confirmed no separate actual test Access identity. Foreign-token, unauthorized/
unprivileged identity, other-role, CSRF, facade-negative, recovery, full audit,
axe/load/JWKS and complete customer regression evidence remains pending/partial.
No all-PASS staging report or certificate was signed. The removed staffing quorum
is not reintroduced. No OTP or paid AI call was made.

The user delegated Environment approvals through the existing reviewer Chrome
session. Those approvals were used successfully; main review protections and
Environment settings remain intact. A run dispatched early (`39290770177`)
failed at authorization before Cloudflare execution because its runner started
before the new run-bound secret was stored. Preserve that FAIL and all earlier
FAIL/UNKNOWN rollback receipts. The original outage checkpoint stash is retained.

Next: unlock Mac/resume real owner smoke and finish missing actual live evidence,
rehearse exact-source OFF/rollback, then sign/protect the completed staging
certificate before the production sequence. Details and exact artifact digests:
`docs/admin/production-readiness/30_STAGING_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_20261020.md`.
Ignored local evidence: `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020`.

This current header supersedes historical statuses and PASS wording below.

# Admin staging live acceptance / rollback fix - 2026-10-20 JST

Runtime main 24cf5d45 has completed staging restore, four Admin migrations, HMAC,
actual owner enrollment/bootstrap, disabled baseline and enable (39270091042
PASS). Real Chrome owner reads and logout were verified. Emergency OFF
39273582548 PASS. Paired rollback 39274064739 and instrumented 39275962070 FAIL /
UNKNOWN: /settings kept reporting latest-upload shutdown bindings while the
reviewed disabled version was receiving 100% traffic. Compensation is observed;
latest GET-only probe sees Admin 4f105c43 and facade f8c39deb, console OFF.
No production Admin operation has run; customer/payments were not mutated.

Candidate codex/admin-active-version-bindings-20261020 verifies serving-version
bindings through deployment/version/deployment reads, rejects split or changed
deployments and duplicate binding names, and uses that selection in receipts.
Focused release/provider/CLI suite 4 files / 215 tests PASS; lint PASS (two existing
generated warnings), both typechecks and Admin build PASS; candidate GET-only
live metadata probe PASS (9 reads, no mutations). Earlier initial test fixture
setup error was corrected; final assertions were retained. Full ST01-ST20 stays
incomplete (ST20 FAIL; negative identity/role/CSRF/facade, recovery, axe/load and
JWKS evidence missing). No staging certificate or production readiness claim.

Next: independent exact-HEAD PR approval and hosted checks, normal merge and
exact-main CI, fresh protected rollback-disabled rehearsal, then new disabled
baseline/enable and complete actual live evidence before production.
Details: docs/admin/production-readiness/30_STAGING_LIVE_ACCEPTANCE_20261020.md.

# Admin restore guard correction - 2026-10-19 JST

The first protected restore attempt `39252519153` on main `e18b12e1` was approved by `vn-taphoanhatung` and failed before any Worker upload because the D1 empty-schema guard rejected Cloudflare's internal `_cf_KV` table. Cloudflare D1 Studio read-only evidence shows `_cf_KV` is exactly `CREATE TABLE _cf_KV ( key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value BLOB ) WITHOUT ROWID`; no application table was observed. The receipt remains `FAIL / UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_OPERATOR_INSPECTION`; no migration, HMAC, owner enrollment, bootstrap, enablement or production mutation occurred.

Candidate branch `codex/admin-d1-system-table-20261019` allows only the exact Cloudflare `_cf_KV` table definition alongside `_cf_METADATA`/SQLite system metadata, and rejects same-name views/tables, application objects, `d1_migrations`, and system-like impostors. Focused provider/admin suite: 205 tests PASS; lint (two pre-existing generated warnings), typecheck, Admin build and whitespace checks PASS. Hosted CI and independent review are required before retrying restore. Keep live acceptance and production status `PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`.

# Admin first-install recovery - 2026-10-19 JST

PR #19 merged normally as 5c44cc5d after exact-HEAD human approval; exact-main CI
39237659372 and Admin CI 39237659377 PASS. Fresh staging/production credential
audits 39238475637/39238479727 PASS with matching target/policy and archive digests.

Protected initialize-disabled 39240631059 passed authorization/pre-action upload
but failed during live execution with fetch failed. Its receipt remains FAIL /
UNKNOWN_REQUIRES_OPERATOR_INSPECTION. Inspection audit 39241507968 confirms the
dedicated staging Workers/hostname were created with the expected source and
console=false; exported Admin bindings are consistent with compensating shutdown.
The old audit omits ADMIN_SHUTDOWN, so its exact marker still needs verification.
Customer Worker sources/bindings match baseline; four anonymous Admin curl probes
redirect correctly to the Access tenant and customer health is ok. No Admin D1
migration, HMAC, owner enrollment/bootstrap, enablement or production Admin release
has been dispatched. All complete-live acceptance rows stay PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.

The candidate adds protected restore-initial-disabled for an unmigrated empty
Admin DB and exact contained source/mapping only. Rechecks precede each fixed
upload, secrets/used schema/unreviewed ancestry/public exposure refuse, rendered
console stays OFF and partial failure contains. Existing initialization/rollback
guards and branch/Environment/signature/certificate protections remain. Public
GET smoke retries only bounded transient transport failures, never bad HTTP/TLS
or provider writes. Raw provider details are suppressed; the original precise
transport cause remains unknown. Audit now exports the shutdown marker safely.

Validation: new regressions first 17 FAIL / 81 PASS on the old provider; final
5-file / 198-test focused suite PASS, real SQLite empty-schema guard and raced
second upload included. Lint PASS (two pre-existing generated warnings), both
typechecks and Admin build PASS (existing font warnings, all fonts emitted).
Dependency audit 438 dependencies/0 vulnerabilities; public scan/whitespace PASS.
See docs/admin/production-readiness/28_INITIAL_INSTALL_RECOVERY.md for receipts.

Supplementary local full suite: 407 files / 9,093 tests, 9,081 PASS / 12 FAIL
in three existing customer tooling files (macOS temporary-path canonicalization,
mock executable paths and a 5-second Wrangler timeout). Corrected isolated rerun
with TMPDIR=/private/tmp and actual Vitest maxWorkers=2 passes 3 files / 125 tests.
No customer tooling files changed; exact-HEAD hosted full CI remains required.

Next: independent exact-HEAD review and CI; protected merge/exact-main checks;
updated staging GET-only audit, then fresh signed restore-initial-disabled.
Continue migrate/HMAC/real-owner login/enroll/bootstrap/disabled baseline/enable,
actual ST01-ST20 and exact-source certificate before protected production.
PayOS/customer runtime/data/credentials/release workflows remain out of scope.

# Admin release CLI correction - 2026-10-19 JST

PR #18 merged as fc5b2f04 after exact-head human review. Exact-main CI
39162677770 and Admin CI 39162677732 succeeded (406 files / 9,066 tests).
The repository Admin execution variable is true; rendered console stays OFF.
Independent off-machine owner-key restore was verified against the reviewed
public fingerprint; no private identity/key/token is published.

Expired staging initialization 39164847244 was canceled without approval or
execution. Fresh initialize-disabled run 39170839984 had a valid one-hour signed
authorization and matching plan archive (artifact 12152671543, SHA-256
b974cbec3a7fc90b5606242b0a3fed716b8d83fbeacc5338c6929cdf590bc8ab).
The owner-authorized browser reviewer vn-taphoanhatung approved admin-staging.
Execution failed in authorize at dynamic provider import with Node exit 13 /
unsettled top-level await. The provider imports the still-evaluating CLI adapter,
so the top-level dynamic import waits on its own module. No pre-action artifact
or operation receipt was created; the Cloudflare credential step was skipped.
No Admin Worker/DNS, D1, HMAC, enrollment/bootstrap or production mutation occurred.

The correction imports createProvider statically; provider module evaluation has
no HTTP/command side effects. Two real Node CLI subprocess regressions use a
clean synthetic Git fixture, an ephemeral signing key and a closed in-process
HTTP boundary. They reproduce exit 13 on fc5b2f04, pass authorization/pre-action
creation with the fix, and still reject a missing independent approval. Related
local validation: six files / 180 tests, whole-project lint (two existing
generated-bundle warnings), both TypeScript checks, Admin build (existing font
resolution warnings; emitted fonts present), public added-text scan and whitespace
checks PASS. Exact-head
hosted CI, independent PR review, protected merge and exact-main checks remain
required before a fresh signed initialization dispatch (never rerun the old run).

Next: publish/review this correction; staging initialize-disabled, migrate,
provision-hmac, direct real-owner Access login and verified subject, enroll-owner,
bootstrap, deploy-disabled, enable, actual ST01-ST20 and signed exact-source
certificate, then the same protected production sequence. Real Access identity,
ST01-ST20 and Admin production remain PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. Customer and
PayOS runtime, data, credentials and release workflows are outside this change.

# Admin guarded activation proposal - 2026-10-18

Current release source on main remains `61a34b74`, disabled and undeployed.
Its exact-main CI/Admin CI and both post-rotation credential audits succeeded.
This candidate proposes both release-policy enabled flags true for the already
verified isolated targets, while rendered console runtime stays false. The
repository execution variable is absent; no live operation was dispatched.

Local validation: 5 focused files / 158 tests, Admin build, lint (one generated
bundle warning), both typechecks, offline target plans/customer-isolation
preflight, public text scan and whitespace checks PASS. Actual ST01-ST20,
verified Access subject and independent off-machine recovery remain
PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. The App Launcher is optional; acquire the real owner
identity through the direct app after protected initialize-disabled. See
docs/admin/production-readiness/26_REVIEWED_ACTIVATION_PROPOSAL.md. Next: exact
candidate CI and independent PR review, normal merge, exact-main CI, then signed
staging initialization. Production still requires a completed staging certificate.

# Admin commissioning publication - 2026-10-18

PR #16: https://github.com/hello-tako/Takolio/pull/16, branch
codex/admin-infrastructure-commissioning-20261018. Initial implementation commit
37bcf42554ed4fd31e290dc1674b0a8321e3824c; required PR checks are running and
reviewDecision=REVIEW_REQUIRED. Final PR HEAD needs its own checks and review;
main 8217f0bd evidence does not certify these commissioning changes.

Executed on the commissioning candidate: pnpm lint PASS; focused credential
workflow/infrastructure/release/config suite 4 files / 92 tests PASS;
admin-public-scan PASS; git diff --check PASS; offline release preflight
configurationValidation=PASS with readyForDeployment=false/remoteExecuted=false.
Earlier local full-run 5-second timeout and subsequent 32/32 rerun remain
attributed in 21_INFRASTRUCTURE_COMMISSIONING.md; hosted exact-main full suites
both passed 9,043 tests. No live evidence status was promoted by those results.

Next: owner creates/enters the scoped credentials through the protected UI,
then exact-HEAD review/CI, merge and exact-main checks, protected credential audit,
real owner key/identity enrollment and the fixed staging release sequence.
The current browser token draft has name/account/Workers Scripts Edit only and
an empty next permission row; no credential was generated. The requested exact
permissions and secret names are in 22_CREDENTIAL_HANDOFF.md. Current runtime
and release policy are still disabled; Admin has not been deployed.

# Admin infrastructure commissioning - 2026-10-18

PR #15 approved at 89349b4c and merged through protection as 8217f0bd.
Exact-main Admin CI 39121353870 and CI 39121353814 both PASS with 405 files /
9,043 tests each; Admin workerd 10/10, migration 25/25, browser 12/12 and
keyboard 10/10 PASS. Main artifact 12134718940 is correctly bound to 8217f0bd;
the preflight is offline-only and reports an untracked Python cache.

Provisioned separate staging/production Admin D1/KV and Access apps, plus
protected admin-staging/admin-production Environments. Both Access apps use the
current Cloudflare owner email, Allow only, 30-minute sessions, and no bypass.
Staging and production HttpOnly/binding cookies are ON; production settings were
read back after Save. Sole-owner private identity stays outside public Git.

Exact-main GET-only audit 39122015225 SUCCESS observed both Admin D1/KV pairs and
customer bindings; readyForDeployment=false. Access organization remains HTTP
403 and filtered app inventory is empty under the old audit credential, so the
credential visibility discrepancy remains PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.

Commissioning policy records all observed nonsecret targets but stays
enabled=false with no rostered signing key. New admin-credential-audit.yml is a
GET-only manual workflow limited to protected Admin Environments and dedicated
Admin secrets, with no fallback to customer credentials. New focused contract
and configuration suite: 4 files / 92 tests PASS. See production-readiness/21
and 22 for identities, evidence attribution and exact credential handoff.

No Admin Worker upload, migration, secret, owner enrollment/bootstrap or console
enable occurred. Scoped credentials, actual verified Access subject, owner-held
Ed25519 key/backup, live staging ST01-ST20 and production release remain
PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. The browser credential final step requires owner
handoff; the draft has only name/account/Workers Scripts Edit prepared.
Customer/payment runtime and customer Environments remain unchanged.

# Admin console current checkpoint - 2026-10-18

PR #15 in hello-tako/Takolio publishes single-owner Admin governance and guarded
first activation from main 571f3c22. Admin 348 tests, metadata delta 4/4,
workerd 10/10, local D1 matrix 25/25, browser 12/12 and keyboard 10/10 pass;
lint/typecheck/build/migration smoke/public scan/dependency audit pass.
Whole-project local regression and exact-head hosted checks were running at
publication; read their final results from PR #15. Configured human review is
required by existing main protection. No Admin live migration, Access/secret or
production deployment occurred. Dedicated infrastructure/identity/staging
acceptance remain PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. Current runbook and verification:
docs/admin/production-readiness/19_SINGLE_OWNER_RELEASE.md and 20_CURRENT_VERIFICATION.md.
Earlier domain/customer checkpoints below retain their source-specific history.

# Production build guard correction - 2026-10-18

Current: DOMAIN_STAGING_VERIFIED on d5f2e726; production cutover pending the reviewed
adapter correction. This checkpoint supersedes earlier domain status sections.
Production remains version 01b81140/source 526596a8. Admin remains reserved.

Staging canonical release 39098613336 succeeded with version 53b3ce38 and both
custom hostnames. Real Google GIS, approved-inbox OTP delivery, refresh/logout,
sandbox QR/provider verification and signed synthetic replay, user journeys and
mobile/PWA smoke were executed. The sandbox event was not a bank settlement or
transfer. Staging scan used its configured mock-AI pipeline. A real paired rollback
restored 5ce93d26, retained the app hostname, detached only the receipt-owned API
hostname and passed audit 39098518311 before canonical same-SHA re-release.
Public evidence with explicit test scope:
https://github.com/hello-tako/Takolio/pull/13#issuecomment-6245968702

The old staging checksum appeared in private tool output. The owner confirmed
rotation and Worker secret update. No new checksum was read. Two real provider
verification callbacks after rotation returned POST 200/outcome ok/exceptions 0;
the canonical webhook was restored. Audit 39101311454 confirms the same active
version/source, isolated bindings, vars, secret names, runtime and operations.
The owner-approved exact-path Access exception retains Worker signatures;
anonymous app/health remain protected.

Read-only production certification 39101415582 was independently approved and
passed at 05:44:39Z. Production release 39101591421 was independently approved by
vn-taphoanhatung, then failed at prepared before upload/traffic/hostname mutation.
Receipt records mutationAttempted=false, no uploadedVersionId and recovery says
no traffic or hostname mutation attempted. Failed evidence remains unchanged.

The actual production build passes. Exact receipt reproduction identifies the
composition CLI's optional config argument as staging-only. The adapter now uses
existing generic composition/planner validators directly against audited production
vars and the compiled UI record, with an explicit production identity check.
Mismatches still fail. Staging, shared validators, customer application, payments,
schema, feature flags and workflow protections are unchanged.

Executed: actual pnpm build and corrected adapter build using the sanitized
production receipt PASS; 19 related files / 288 tests PASS (11 new build cases);
lint, both TypeScript checks and customer/Admin migration smoke PASS. Two existing
generated-bundle lint warnings and existing Admin font warnings remain. Exact-head
hosted CI and independent PR review remain mandatory; full hosted result pending.

Next: protected fix review/merge and exact-main CI, new canonical staging receipt
and accurate acceptance on the new SHA, fresh production certification and release
approval, then at least 15 real minutes and final live acceptance. Do not relabel
an old-SHA attestation as a test of the new release. See 24-production-build-guard.md.

# Domain release checkpoint - 2026-10-18 JST

PR #8 merged normally as 0a9f63ca5e92eab649e4745961a6fcc7bb70c225 after exact-head
approval and both required hosted checks succeeded (395 files / 8,885 tests each;
Admin additionally passed Worker boundaries, migrations and browser/keyboard gates).
Both exact-main checks, CI 39045489657 and Admin CI 39045489679, succeeded. No production deployment was triggered by the merge.

Fresh read-only staging audit 39045069392 passed at 02337f88, including active
account/zone, isolated bindings, Queue operations and all 43 migrations. Staging
release 39045380675 then failed at Access preflight before upload/traffic/hostname
mutation. Its retained receipt says mutationAttempted=false. The Cloudflare
dashboard session requires login, and native Chrome reports the Mac locked. The
owner has been asked to unlock and log in; no password/token/OTP was requested.

Branch feat/domain-production-gated-release, based on the PR #8 merge, prepares
a protected manual production adapter. It requires same-SHA staging infrastructure,
actual browser/provider/rollback acceptance with public evidence, fresh production
read-only certification, exact-main CI/Admin CI and independent production
Environment approval. Strict upload is verified before traffic. Owned hostname
removal precedes code rollback; repeated probes last at least 15 real minutes.
It reports only infrastructure-observed until separate final acceptance exists.

Both adapters now hash unrelated account hostname metadata in public receipts,
then privately reconstruct exact commitments before recovery. Staging fetch
rejects redirects without following or disclosing Location/body/credentials and
reports only HTTP status. No security gate, assertion or timeout is relaxed.

Validation: 12 focused files / 388 tests PASS; lint (two existing ignored generated
bundle warnings), both TS checks, migration smoke, Web/Admin/Worker build, changed
ESLint, public scan and diff checks PASS. Full local runs are NOT PASS: first
8,894 passed / four timeout failures during a documented 901-second clamshell
sleep; final attempt 8,892 passed / six failures plus a worker timeout during
continued system sleep (4376.41 seconds, incomplete 396-file run). Use exact-head
hosted CI for complete validation. Prepare a draft PR; do not merge or activate
before its required hosted checks and independent review succeed.

No application upload, traffic activation, new hostname, DNS/data/email/payment
or Admin mutation occurred through this lane. Production retains its prior
version/source. Real staging acceptance and the production cutover remain pending.
Status: DOMAIN_SECURITY_REVIEW_REQUIRED.

# Domain release checkpoint - 2026-10-17 14:19 UTC

PR #6 merged normally as `51d3590ad88c59128d15a746b4e3dfe5b7b8fb72` after exact-head
approval and successful CI/Admin CI. Both hosted suites passed 393 files / 8,855
tests; Admin also passed Worker boundaries, migration matrix, 12 browser cases
and 10 keyboard repetitions. Exact-new-main checks 39040157903 and 39040157898
are running. The automatic catalog workflow only ran its registration job;
production gate/recover jobs were skipped.

Implementation `2129545f` fixes observed 40-character custom-domain IDs, preserves
32-character receipts and moves hostname preflight before upload/traffic. Its
branch includes the new main merge without changing application code. Targeted
regression passes 10 files / 391 tests. Full lint, typecheck, migration smoke,
Web/Admin/Worker build, public-text scan and whitespace checks pass. Additional
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2` is running; do not claim
its result before completion. Final-head hosted checks and independent review
remain required before the normal protected merge.

Canonical staging audit 39039057157 passed all 43 migrations and operational
checks. A supplementary read-only check confirms production and staging still
serve their recorded old deployment/version/source IDs. No application upload,
traffic activation, new hostname, DNS, data, email, payment or Admin mutation has
occurred. Staging provider/browser/rollback acceptance and a separately reviewed
production lane remain pending. Next: review/merge this tooling fix, pass exact
main checks, then dispatch the reviewed staging lane with fresh audit evidence.
Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS`.

# Live custom-domain ID compatibility - 2026-10-17

PR #6 has exact-head approval for `ccf00bea`; CI 39038226587 succeeded with
393 files / 8,855 tests. Admin CI 39038226579 remains pending at this checkpoint.
Both previous main checks and canonical read-only staging audit 39039057157 passed.
The staging Environment token can read all required runtime/Queue/D1 evidence;
all 43 source migrations match. No migration was applied.

A further supplementary read-only account domain inventory found 21 domain IDs,
all 40 lowercase hex characters, while the adapter expected 32. The failure was
reproduced before changing code. The fix retains 32-character receipts, accepts
observed 40-character IDs and uses the same validator in rollback DELETE guards.
Zone IDs remain 32 characters, ownership/conflict/drift checks remain enforced,
and malformed lengths/path suffixes/other resources remain rejected. Staging
preparation now validates account domains and hostname conflicts before upload
or traffic activation; attachment still rechecks live fences and records its own
returned IDs. No permission change or external mutation occurred.

Validation: 10 focused domain/release/asset files / 391 tests PASS, changed-file
ESLint PASS, and all 21 actual domain entries now validate with only the two
approved staging targets planned. Exact checks and limitations are recorded in
`docs/domain-integration/18-live-domain-id-compatibility.md`. This tooling fix
needs normal protected merge and exact-main CI before staging release.
Staging email-provider setup and real Google/OTP/PayOS sandbox/session/mobile/PWA/
rollback acceptance remain pending. Production is unchanged; Admin stays reserved.
Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS`.

# Queue consumer API compatibility - 2026-10-17

PR #5 merged normally as `0900b013613fb1da62b0907b04eaf20734a9ac26` after
vn-taphoanhatung approved exact head `4b54fe56` and both required hosted checks
passed. CI and Admin CI each passed 393 files / 8,842 tests; Admin additionally
passed the real Worker boundary, migration matrix, 12 browser cases and 10 keyboard
repetitions. Exact-merge-main CI 39037543517 and Admin CI 39037543525 are pending.

A supplementary read-only request against the actual staging Queue consumers API
returned the exact Worker `script: frigo-staging` without the deprecated service
`environment` field. Its automatic concurrency setting omits `max_concurrency`.
Cloudflare's UI independently shows automatic concurrency and the expected
5-item/10-second/3-retry consumer with its staging DLQ. No queue setting changed.

The config adapter previously rejected both omissions. Two focused regression
cases reproduce those failures on main. This fix accepts an exact direct script
identity without a legacy environment, still requires production environment for
legacy service identity, rejects conflicting identities and preserves omitted/null
automatic concurrency by omitting the Wrangler override. Explicit positive limits
remain unchanged; invalid values, unknown settings, wrong DLQ, extra consumers,
source/CI/environment fences and all operational drift checks remain rejected.

Validation: focused domain/release checks and changed-module lint are recorded in
`docs/domain-integration/17-queue-consumer-compatibility.md`. Fresh exact-head CI
and independent review are mandatory before merging this fix. This is a local
config fix, not an upload, activation or live staging acceptance. The complete
hosted audit still needs to pass. Staging email-provider setup and real
Google/OTP/PayOS sandbox/session/mobile/PWA/rollback acceptance remain pending.
Production is unchanged and Admin remains disabled/undeployed.
Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS`.

# Domain activation preparation - 2026-10-17

PR #3 merged normally into main as
`0de18ff90963ae84dbaa4dc16eb0257a250510d1`. Both required merge-commit jobs,
`validate` (39025377241) and `validate-admin` (39025377368), passed. The first
live staging Domain Infrastructure Audit (39026886923) stopped before producing
a complete receipt because the deployments endpoint returned multiple pages.
The follow-up reads bounded deployment pages, checks page/count consistency and
duplicate IDs, and still refuses incomplete unrelated inventories.

The new hostname operations module plans only the configured Takolio hosts,
preserves the complete supplied domain inventory and records each mutation intent
and returned ID before proceeding. It refuses DNS/route/ownership conflicts,
external drift and ambiguous responses. Rollback can detach only IDs created by
that receipt; correct pre-existing and unrelated domains are retained. It is an
injected-I/O module, not an enabled workflow, deploy command or live mutation.
Pinned Wrangler's bulk custom-domain reconciliation is unsuitable for the first
cutover because it can replace omitted origins and override existing DNS.

Google OAuth production origin `https://takolio.app` was saved and verified in
Google Cloud project `selinow-auth`. Separate public client
`Takolio Staging Web` was created with only `https://staging.takolio.app` and no
redirect URI. Its client ID is
`509963441971-c8ij1hv901p0fsljhd2ur1qc4t63432g.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
No client secret was retained. This is provider configuration evidence, not a
successful hosted sign-in. No new Worker version or domain/DNS change occurred.

Local checks: two focused files / 17 tests, targeted ESLint, both TypeScript
checks, Admin configuration preflight, public text scan and whitespace checks
PASS. Fresh hosted exact-head validation is pending.
Temporary credential files were previously emptied; a local API diagnostic using
those empty files was rejected before a complete audit. It is not evidence of a
Cloudflare permission failure. Secrets remain in their GitHub Environments.

Cloudflare Access `Takolio Staging Access` is now saved for both staging
hostnames and the `frigo-staging` Worker URLs after the owner confirmed creation.
Its exact-email Allow policy is
`Takolio staging approved tester` (policy ID `814bebea-4fcf-4582-88ea-d21fd12d153c`)
and the application ID is `bd0bae35-56b4-4766-a3b5-9de378ba93ad`. The policy
allows only the privately recorded owner-approved inbox for a 24-hour session.
An unauthenticated HTTPS probe of the legacy Worker now returns HTTP 302 to
Cloudflare Access. The two new staging hosts remain unreachable until DNS/domain
attachment. No Worker application version was deployed. A local read-only OAuth
diagnostic successfully read the real deployment history through the new code,
then stopped on missing DNS-read scope (HTTP 403 / code 10000). This is distinct
from the scoped Environment tokens, which still require a hosted audit.
Staging OAuth/email bindings,
real Google/OTP delivery and sandbox PayOS acceptance, fresh complete cloud audits,
the reviewed deploy adapter, staging rollback rehearsal and production
Environment review remain gates. Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED`;
production domain cutover is pending, Admin remains reserved and undeployed.

Next: publish this follow-up PR, obtain exact-head checks and independent human
review, merge normally, rerun the read-only audit, then complete the reviewed
activation workflow and live staging acceptance before production.

# Admin release guard follow-up - 2026-10-17

Hosted CI `validate` passed on `09d425a1` (run 39021612765). The required
Admin CI run 39021612780 passed lint, types, the full suite, migration smoke and
build, then failed its release preflight because intentional domain entry/type
changes were compared with the original customer commit. The human approval of
`09d425a1` was verified; this follow-up requires a fresh approval after push.

Preflight now selects only the immutable reviewed domain commit `352a4211` when
it is in HEAD ancestry and parallel main history has no protected customer byte
changes. Current working/committed customer edits still fail the final comparison.
The downstream migration matrix likewise accepts descendant main history only
when its pinned migrations/schema contract is unchanged; the 43-file ledger,
historical failure cases and Admin database isolation stay strict.

Local follow-up checks: baseline/config 16/16, real local D1 matrix 23/23,
preflight, targeted lint, both TypeScript checks, public scan and diff check PASS.
The matrix ran against the edited script and records dirty scoped paths; it is
not hosted certification of the next commit. Exact-head CI remains required.
The real local multi-Worker boundary check also passes 10/10 scenarios, including
its synthetic browser and production-bundle isolation checks.

Google Cloud client details were recovered through the authenticated UI. The
Frigo production client currently authorizes only localhost and the legacy host;
new Takolio origins are not yet saved. OAuth/provider acceptance, the read-only
live infrastructure audit, deployment activation/rollback implementation and
staging acceptance remain release gates. Production/domain state is unchanged;
Admin remains disabled and undeployed. Next: publish this fix, obtain fresh
human review, pass exact-head CI, then follow the protected release gates.

---

# Final local verification - 2026-10-17

Full canonical-temp run: 388 files / 8,804 tests PASS. Final focused audit/config/
readiness/Admin guard run: 44/44 PASS; independent read-only delta review PASS.
Lint, both TypeScript checks and public-change scan PASS. The full run overlapped
final audit fixes; final focused checks and exact-commit hosted CI cover that
delta. Prior build/migration smoke also passed. No new application/domain deploy
has occurred. Fresh final-head GitHub review and CI remain mandatory. See
`docs/domain-integration/14-release-operations.md`.

---

# Credential and release checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED`; new-domain staging acceptance and
production cutover remain pending. The owner authorized production release and
confirmed creating/saving the reviewed separate Cloudflare tokens. Both 30-day
API tokens and account-ID secrets are now saved in their matching GitHub
Environments; expiry is 2026-11-16. Separate release-verification keys are also
synchronized with the Workers and proven by authenticated HTTP 200 responses.
Secret rotation preserved code/runtime/bindings/assets. Current production
version is `01b81140-3162-47e0-8573-88b679877f8a` (source `526596a8`); staging is
`b4257b5c-dddf-4093-b969-f5bc09888bf6` (source `f7386e6a`). This was credential
provisioning, not a new application/domain deployment. Admin is undeployed.

The post-main-merge CI failure was isolated to the Admin customer-baseline test
(8,794 other tests passed); its reviewed-baseline guard and the public documentation
scan are fixed. Generated production candidates now explicitly preserve
workers.dev/preview OFF. A manual current-schema read-only Cloudflare audit is
prepared; the historical 0039-only readiness contract remains intact. Final-head
hosted CI and fresh PR #3 approval are required; prior approval was dismissed by
GitHub after the main merge. Main and Environment protections remain enforced.

Next: finish final-head CI/review, merge normally, pass exact-main CI and execute
read-only infrastructure audits. Resolve operational/provider/isolation evidence
before reviewing a deployment activation path; the default Deploy workflow still
uses legacy configs. Do not dispatch it as a domain cutover. Live staging must
pass before production Environment approval and rollout. See
`docs/domain-integration/14-release-operations.md` for evidence and exact gates.

# Release operations checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Canonical repository: `hello-tako/Takolio` (`1422954151`). Admin prerequisite PR #2
was approved by `vn-taphoanhatung` at exact head `84554b0f` and merged through
branch protection as `304349ea09d542881eb09033327fdd0ff8c2d272`.
This does not activate or deploy the Admin Console. Domain PR #3 was approved at
`352a4211`; it is being integrated with the new main and requires fresh exact-head
CI and review. Its last complete hosted run was 39011736920: 368 files / 8499 tests
passed, plus lint, type checks, migration validation and production build.
Local isolated browser regression: 94/94 passed (synthetic providers).

The owner authorized production release and creating necessary Cloudflare tokens.
GitHub staging/production Environments and account-ID secrets are restored;
production still requires independent environment review without admin bypass.
Cloudflare tokens are being provisioned with limited scope and 30-day expiry.
New-domain live staging/provider acceptance remains pending; production/DNS are
unchanged. Keep the existing planner/T20 flags and isolated storage. Never infer
staging or production verification from local tests or candidate dry runs.

# Current checkpoint: Takolio domain integration - 2026-10-17

Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED`; staging blocked; production NOT_CHANGED. This checkpoint supersedes historical operational claims below for the current domain task.

Canonical source: `hello-tako/Takolio`, repository ID `1422954151`; base `526596a8cd857984ad2b69901a8c7b0e9d6bccc2`; branch `feat/takolio-app-domain-integration`. Both combined Workers are preserved, Admin remains reserved. Default Wrangler files, payment business logic and storage schema are unchanged. New routing is dormant until an explicitly reviewed generated candidate enables it.

Implemented: central domain profiles, exact host boundaries, safe WWW document redirects, preserved legacy app/API, API-only aliases, noindex/SEO, verified native association 404 boundaries, current-host export attribution, local read-only capture/probes and candidate preparation. Candidate preparation checks complete supported typed bindings, compatibility, staging overlap and clean source identity, and reports outstanding operational audit blockers. Unknown binding shapes are rejected.

Actual local verification: full run before final review fixes 367 files / 8,496 tests PASS (811.53s). After review fixes, 86 focused domain/config/CORS/Workerd tests PASS; domain + export presentation subset 38 PASS. Lint, both TypeScript checks, paired planner/T20 build, migration smoke and high-severity dependency audit PASS. Initial synthetic harness failures (stale validator, Hono HSTS ordering) were corrected; actual Workerd harness initially omitted has_user_worker and was corrected without relaxing assertions. Legacy HSTS regression assertion required the outer header to preserve existing strict legacy asset policy. No tests were skipped or timeouts increased.

Browser: isolated synthetic SQLite preview, mobile 390x844 and desktop 1440x1000. Created 7-day family meal plan, opened shopping view, refreshed nested route, no horizontal overflow or broken images on inspected views. This is local regression evidence, not live domain or real Google/OTP/PayOS certification. Plain Vite static preview initially showed session-unavailable because no API was attached; switched to existing isolated API preview.

Cloudflare: account `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`, active zone `takolio.app` / `9284fb2186987f14f810818583acaa46`, Universal SSL active. DNS 0 records, Worker routes 0, Redirect rules 0, no Worker connected. Access has 3 unrelated apps and no Takolio staging protection. Edge HSTS, live cron/consumers/observability and account-wide DO/Workflows remain unverified. Pages/D1 list NOT_ACCESSIBLE with current OAuth. Existing staging storage/queue IDs are distinct, but sandbox provider credentials/data sensitivity are unverified.

Live versions: production `35dd189e-7e3c-4782-b69b-237da7dadd62`, SHA equals verified main; staging `b97b11fe-9151-41ac-9130-52532c045c8e`, SHA `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1` exists and is ancestor of main. Read-only probes reached legacy production/staging; all five new hosts unreachable. No DNS, Worker, database, secret, OAuth, email or payment mutation occurred.

Next: final exact-head draft PR/hosted CI and independent review; then authorized operator resolves Cloudflare scope, live settings, staging Access/data/provider isolation, Google JS origins and approved OTP inbox. New-domain staging acceptance must precede any separate owner production approval. Current repository has 0 Actions secrets and 0 Environments; historical deployment identity/approval controls need reviewed restoration before release. Do not weaken branch protection or route Admin.

Details: `docs/domain-integration/FINAL-ACCEPTANCE.md`, `12-production-runbook.md`, `13-rollback-runbook.md`. Rollback pairs previous code with the recorded routes/settings/provider configuration; database rollback is excluded.

# Takolio repository safeguards checkpoint - 2026-10-17

Canonical repository hello-tako/Takolio (1422954151), candidate branch
codex/takolio-identity-safeguards-20261017, based on acb47fe5. All original
957 commits and mapped upgrade branches remain intact. Main remains 526596a8.

Active Admin release identity/API/CI/rollback contracts now pin the new ID/name;
legacy signatures and old repository CI are rejected. Release targets remain
disabled. Historical customer production approval contracts are preserved.
CI Vitest scheduling is serial via a dedicated config extending unchanged
Vite configuration, with unchanged assertions and timeout budgets. Original CI run 39004821831 failed
one 5s wrong-password flood test; that failure remains recorded. The first
follow-up full run failed only the customer-config guard (8,774 PASS); the
customer Vite config is now restored byte-for-byte and the guard passes.

Local focused 4 files/124 tests, lint, types, build, migration smoke, audit-high,
release config preflight, public patch scan and diff checks PASS. Published-head
CI and exact SHA are recorded in the PR/external migration receipt. Main now has
enforced required checks, fresh independent review and force/deletion protection.
Actions defaults to read-only and cannot approve PRs. No reviewer/secret/Environment
was fabricated. See docs/repository-migration/2026-10-17-follow-up.md.

Blocked: GitHub account suspended prevents ref refresh/push/hosted CI; four
release workflows remain offline plans with no reviewed live adapters; protections,
real Access/resource identity, independent human roster/custody, representative
D1 load and all live staging/rollback gates are unverified. Staging authorization
is required; production is not deployed or authorized. Next: restore GitHub,

# PR #77 brand-main merge verification — 2026-10-16

**Result:** four conflicts resolved in merge
`03a84b03e0b11b93c0e2ab2a6c56cc29cf3fa845` (parents `73e0c490`, `526596a8`).
On that exact source: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`,
`pnpm check:migrations` and focused Admin/brand Vitest all exit0. Regression
command: `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/admin- tests/integration/admin-
tests/unit/takolio-brand.test.mjs tests/unit/takolio-3d-assets.test.mjs
tests/unit/takolio-mascot.test.tsx --maxWorkers=1 --silent`: 13 files /143 tests
PASS. Both customer/Admin migration smoke markers are `ok`. Existing Admin font
build warnings remain; the expected emitted font files are present.

Both complete parent status histories survive. Main's Takolio and V3 brand
commands and all prior Admin commands/build/migration checks coexist in valid
package JSON, with dependencies and lockfile unchanged. Customer runtime/assets,
configs/migrations and incoming brand artifacts match merged main byte-for-byte;
Admin runtime/config/schema matches the previous PR head. Resolution-path diff
checks and conflict-marker scans pass. Broad merge diff whitespace warnings are
inherited verbatim font licenses / historical logs, not new resolution changes;
those authoritative files were not reformatted. Separate local R2 stays excluded.

**Next:** publish only this handoff merge/receipt and require exact-head hosted CI.
Full repository tests and browser E2E were not rerun locally for this conflict

# PR #77 brand-main conflict reconciliation — 2026-10-16

**Scope:** merge main `526596a8cd857984ad2b69901a8c7b0e9d6bccc2` into handoff `73e0c490a15e2014abb6e5096ec45ec980981d37`.
Resolved three docs/ai status conflicts by keeping both complete parent histories.
Resolved package.json by retaining main's `brand:icons` Takolio generator and
`brand:icons:v3` legacy generator alongside all handoff Admin commands and the
existing Admin-aware build/migration checks. No dependency/lockfile change.
All customer source/assets/configs/migrations and incoming brand evidence are
identical to main; no custom product, authentication, payment or release edit.
Separate local R2 commits remain excluded from this historical handoff PR.

**Checks:** both-parent status content retention, package JSON/script assertions,
no conflict markers/unmerged paths, customer/main byte identity and diff check.
Lint/types/build/migration/Admin regression results follow in the verification

**Scope:** merge current main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1` into handoff
`87d6d3d2acc69a6ca3f0409c3c22753469807222` without rebasing or publishing local R2 work.
Resolved conflicts in `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` and
`docs/ai/TASK_BOARD.md` by retaining both the Admin handoff notice and all new
main-side status entries. Customer runtime, configs, migration history and main's
T26/T27 changes are taken unchanged from the merged main. No new product/UI,
authentication, payment, deployment or remote database change is introduced.

**Checks:** conflict-marker scan, main/head status-document content retention,
customer-source identity against merged main, and staged diff validation.
Additional lint/types/migration/admin regression results are recorded in the
follow-up verification checkpoint. This merge does not resolve Admin F1–F11 or
certify staging/production. The separate local R2 branch is not part of this PR.

**Next:** publish only this handoff merge, require exact-head CI, retain draft /
DO NOT MERGE status and independent-review/release gates. No PR merge or close.

# Takolio mascot and full-app visual upgrade checkpoint - 2026-10-16 JST

**Repository:** `lol-vn/Tako-san`, immutable ID `1385308553`, protected main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1`, branch `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`. Implementation commit `dae71688bde863608a20855b56351ccd51d99c34`. Draft PR: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79. Final publication SHA, automatic hosted CI and independent final binding are recorded in the PR and local delivery receipt after this documentation checkpoint; earlier-head CI is not current-head evidence.

**Implementation:** the operator selected both 3D mascot refinement and app-wide presentation work. Six genuine Blender poses have softer materials, smoother hat/eye details, multi-segment/IK silhouettes and attached spoon/bowl props; six 2048px masters generate 18 responsive WebPs. Shared compact styles improve heading rhythm, card spacing, account grouping and Navy-on-Blush navigation (11.6676:1 indicator contrast). Home empty-plan layout, narrow missing-media labels and empty-fridge scan/manual-add actions are readable. Short compact viewports keep navigation in document flow for enlarged text. Landing has responsive copy/actions and a mascot scene. Existing logo/wordmark correction remains. `/plus` is excluded from compact rules and all six matched /plus screenshots are pixel-identical.

**Local verification:** lint, typecheck, audit-high, generator, migration smoke, default/paired ON/OFF builds PASS. Focused 6 files /51 tests PASS; full rerun 365 files /8,479 tests PASS (357.38s wrapper duration); protected synthetic E2E 94/94 PASS. Matched before/after 198 screens per side, six widths 320/375/390/768/1024/1440, zero after axe findings/page errors/broken assets/overflow; mascot 72, stress 24, PWA 3, states 15 and flags OFF 12 PASS. Exact argv/environment/exit/log hashes and current observations are in `docs/brand/takolio/v1/evidence/upgrade/`. Normal browser/PWA checks retain CSP; synthetic font stress alone bypasses CSP for test injection. No production login, OTP delivery or real payment settlement was used.

**Retained failure:** the first full run had 8,478 passes and one unchanged Wrangler local test exceeding 5s under concurrent load. The affected 32-test file passed separately, then the full unchanged suite passed after heavy browser/render work finished. No test timeout/assertion/config was weakened. Intermediate render, font-harness, route-capture and unsupported outDir failures remain local evidence, not acceptance results.

**Independent review/protection:** the separate read-only reviewer found no open concrete code/design/security findings in the implementation or matched sheets; implementation source matches its reviewed snapshot `9a3511173e4c822b8588f7c0d9483a6a077c57dfcd44ce3546b7a7c2042aeffb`. Final published-head binding is still required. All 299 audited protected files and 54 V3 assets are byte-identical to follow-up baseline `0db4ce2f4c5823eaf7fd085921e3b3a7ba0d8608` ; 69 prior Takolio runtime entries unchanged, 18 WebPs updated, 87 entries/996,320 bytes total. No PayOS/payment/auth logic, Worker, database/migration, household/inventory/Week/recipe authority, flags, domain, persisted-ID or workflow edit. Database state is unchanged outside disposable local fixtures.

**Limits/next:** `3D_CANDIDATE_REVIEW_REQUIRED` and `PREMIUM_MASCOT_FINISHING_PENDING`; no 100% concept/premium/legal/native-release claim. Full production facial/deformation/grip finishing, legal/trademark clearance, physical-device installs and hosted signed-in/offline household-data acceptance remain open. 25 protected legacy source-copy locations remain deferred. Commit documentation/evidence, push feature branch, read automatic exact-head CI, bind independent review, then owner/reviewers inspect draft PR. Revert the follow-up to restore prior presentation/render bytes while retaining both asset trees and existing service-worker release-ID cache rotation. Do not merge/deploy/dispatch/publish/change domains or payment systems.

# Takolio V1 3D candidate follow-up - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` until the new feature commit is pushed, automatic exact-head CI is read, and independent review binds to that SHA. Draft PR #79 remains OPEN/DRAFT: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79. No merge, deploy, workflow dispatch or main push is authorized.

**Repository/base:** canonical `lol-vn/Tako-san`, immutable ID `1385308553`; live main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1`; working branch `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`; previous published head `ac7956952fbdfaaddbf379f0fb2355aa922ae1a1`. The current worktree is dirty with the 3D candidate integration and evidence; final branch SHA will be recorded after commit.

**Implementation:** six pinned Blender-derived 2048px RGBA masters now generate 18 responsive WebP mascot illustrations through `pnpm brand:icons`. `TakoMascot` uses WebP for illustrations >=96 CSS px and keeps the canonical SVG fallback; small controls, error states and protected Plus/payment consumers retain vector behavior. The heart-badge geometry was rerendered after independent review found a visible spike. The native `.blend`/`.glb` remain local handoff outputs and are not runtime assets.

**Validation:** focused 6 files / 51 tests PASS; full local unit 365 files / 8,479 tests PASS; lint, typecheck, default/ON/OFF builds, migration smoke and generator PASS; protected E2E 94/94 PASS; mascot browser matrix 72/72 PASS at 320/375/390/768/1024/1440; state checks 15/15, PWA 3/3 and flags-OFF 12/12 PASS. Final fallback receipt passes after clearing synthetic auth state. Evidence is in `docs/brand/takolio/v1/evidence/mascot-3d/` and the local delivery package is recorded in `MASCOT_3D.md`.

**Protected scope:** final audit reports 299 compared protected paths unchanged relative to the previous implementation head, 69 prior runtime entries byte-identical, and no payment/auth logic, Worker, database, migration, recipe, household, Week, flag, domain or persisted-ID change. The public file scan found no ZIP/PDF/boards/native model/secrets in the repository; it is not a legal or comprehensive secret certification.

**Open limits/next:** premium mascot finishing, exact concept fidelity, rig/weight/prop polish, physical-device/native acceptance, legal/trademark clearance and hosted signed-in/offline household-data acceptance remain open. Commit coherent changes, push feature branch only, update draft PR body, wait for automatic CI, obtain independent final binding, then request owner review. Do not merge or deploy.

# Takolio V1 corrective publication checkpoint - 2026-10-16 JST

**Implementation:** corrective header commit `617c52b3a095227a90e36a10bb08449e1a3ab1c2` is pushed to `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`. Canonical repository `lol-vn/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`), live main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1`. PR #79 remains OPEN/DRAFT/MERGEABLE: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79. Worktree was clean after the implementation push. This checkpoint only updates publication documentation, the exact interrupted-test command and file hashes.

**Validation:** 363 files / 8,474 tests PASS in 163.49s with bundled Node 24.19.0 and TMPDIR=/private/tmp. Focused 46, matched header 36, PWA 3, states 15, flags-OFF 12, lint, typecheck, migrations, generator and default/ON/OFF builds PASS. Historical failures remain disclosed. Independent corrective code/design/security review has no concrete findings; final documentation-head binding and automatic hosted CI are pending at this checkpoint. Run 38816613109 started automatically on the implementation head; this documentation commit gets its own automatic PR run. No manual workflow dispatch.

**Status/next:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` until the final published head has successful hosted CI and independent binding. Final SHA/check/review receipts will be recorded in the PR body and delivery outputs, avoiding a self-referential commit/hash cycle. Then owner/reviewers inspect the new head and exclusions. The earlier owner approval is retained as reported and is not represented as a GitHub approval of this new head.

**Boundaries:** no new runtime/source/generator/test/CI-workflow/PayOS/auth/Worker/database/migration/flag/domain changes in this checkpoint; no merge or deploy. Header correction changes presentation only; both asset trees and persisted identifiers remain. Candidate glyph, premium 3D, legal/trademark, protected-copy and native/device/hosted-offline gaps remain explicit.

# Takolio V1 corrective header checkpoint - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` until the corrective header commit receives independent review and exact-head hosted CI. User approved draft PR #79, but this follow-up changes its head after that approval.

**Finding and fix:** the shared kitchen header used a 44px `symbol-micro.svg`, so Home, Recipes, Planner Setup and Shopping lacked visible `Takolio` text. `KitchenHeader` now uses the canonical outlined horizontal lockup at 180px; below 375px with a back control it selects the 120px outlined wordmark through `<picture>`. Tablet keeps the lockup in the header, while the desktop rail continues using its 168px wordmark and the narrow rail keeps its symbol.

**Kit alignment:** the implementation follows `02_LOGO_USAGE.md`: horizontal for website headers, icon-only for genuinely narrow/avatar contexts, no live-text substitution, no board crop. The supplied candidate glyph geometry and 2D mascot remain documented fidelity limits; this is not a 100% concept-board or premium-3D claim.

**Checks:** targeted synthetic header run: 36/36 screens PASS at 320/375/390/768/1024/1440, zero axe violations, zero page errors, zero broken images, no overflow, 44px actions and keyboard home-link focus PASS. Focused unit tests: 4 files / 46 tests PASS. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm brand:icons` PASS. Broad `ux_audit.py` is recorded as NOT a gate: 110 checks passed but repository-wide scan exited FAIL with 59 issues / 1,859 warnings. Rebased inventory baseline is `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1`; 25 protected deferred product-copy locations remain.

**Additional verification:** paired ON/OFF builds PASS; PWA 3/3, states 15/15 and flags OFF 12/12 PASS. Actual computed palette/font checks PASS on landing/auth/onboarding, which each own their own `.takosan-rebuild` scope. Independent corrective code/design/security review found no concrete findings and reran 46 tests. Initial raw `pnpm test` encountered 11 existing macOS temp-path normalization failures; the affected two files pass 93/93 with documented `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`. The complete rerun passes 363 files / 8,474 tests in 163.49s (exit 0), using bundled Node v24.19.0 with `TMPDIR=/private/tmp`. The Node 25 rerun was stopped after an existing Python subprocess waited for stdin EOF; its diagnostic logs remain retained. Custom build `--outDir` was rejected by the existing SW token hook; standard output OFF build PASS without configuration changes.

**Protected scope:** no PayOS/payment/checkout/webhook, auth behavior, Worker, migrations, database, domain, flags, production infrastructure or persisted identifiers changed. Old `/takosan/v3` assets remain retained.

**Next:** commit the verified corrective branch, push feature branch only, update draft PR #79, wait for exact-head hosted CI and independent review binding. Record the final committed head and hosted result in the delivery receipt and PR body. Do not merge or deploy.

# Takolio V1 final reviewed implementation - 2026-10-16 JST

**Implementation status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_IMPLEMENTED_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Canonical public repository `lol-vn/Tako-san`, immutable ID `1385308553`; branch `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`; refreshed main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1`; verified implementation/integration `b5ba0cc2594ef83431693118f92350b6e81674f1`. Worktree was clean after push. Draft PR #79 is OPEN/DRAFT/MERGEABLE: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79.

**Hosted verification:** automatic pull-request run `38809062361` is SUCCESS on that exact head: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/actions/runs/38809062361. Hosted lint/typecheck, all 363 files / 8,473 tests (565.45s), local SQLite migration smoke and web/Worker build PASS. The bounded native RGB rounding guard passes on Ubuntu. No manual workflow dispatch occurred. This documentation-only checkpoint follows the verified integration; its own automatic CI must still be read at the final published head and recorded in the output receipt/PR before completion.

**Independent review:** separate `/root/independent_brand_review` found no concrete code/design/security/compatibility findings on the integration head. It verified 238 ledger hashes, 69 runtime hashes, 17 current log hashes, 425 legacy files and 748 protected paths; root tokens unchanged and auth display literals only. Independent final rerun 4 files / 45 tests PASS (2.00s), log hash `ce14731a61de2bd7250c7bac1aada8b7e8569f9bf0ed2420691a56d5f14479d7`. It reviewed matched mobile/desktop and narrow planner/scan proof. No human GitHub approval is claimed. `evidence/main-sync/` records the receipts.

**Changes/database state:** implementation remains canonical Takolio with preserved compatibility facades/assets and incoming compact UI behavior. This checkpoint only records verified CI/review and refreshes hashes; it does not change runtime, sources, generator, tests or workflows. No production/database/domain/flag/PayOS mutation, deployment or feature-to-main merge. All prior history and failures remain preserved.

**Handoff/next:** wait for automatic CI of the final documentation head; update final receipt/PR with that exact result. Owner/reviewers review the draft, source provenance, visuals and exclusions. Keep 25 protected legacy-copy locations, legal/trademark clearance, premium 3D finishing, native/device and hosted signed-in/offline household-data gaps explicit. Do not merge/deploy/publish a release without separate operator authorization.

# Takolio V1 refreshed-main integration - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` pending automatic hosted `validate` on the committed integration head and final independent evidence review. Draft PR #79 remains OPEN/DRAFT: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79.

**Repository/base:** `lol-vn/Tako-san`, immutable ID `1385308553`. Initial migration base `03428467cdd5e93d27a3a27e5edaf7d512eef71d`; refreshed live main `f7386e6a8d9ef8955cc314daebf4d1aeecf4e5a1` incorporates PR #80. This integration brings that main into the feature branch only; it does not merge the feature into main. Previous pushed feature head is `00befc505c578bfa41e854ed69b0438ad355644f`; this checkpoint records the verified tree before its merge commit exists.

**Changes:** retain incoming compact kitchen structure, setup/shopping copy and interaction behavior; map five compact CSS colors to existing semantic tokens and change new display references to Takolio. Canonical assets, generators and protected systems remain unchanged. Synthetic browser fixture starts tomorrow's valid plan and waits for scan confirmation readiness before checking images. Historical docs from both branches are preserved.

**Executed:** complete local unit suite PASS 363 files / 8,473 tests (571.29s); focused 8 files / 118 PASS; E2E 94/94 PASS (7.1m); lint, typecheck, migration smoke, canonical generator and default/paired ON/OFF builds PASS. Refreshed matched browser evidence: 198 before/after screens at six widths; main has 18 existing axe findings, Takolio after has zero axe findings and one retained transient image race at scan-review/320; focused recheck PASS after the harness wait correction. States 15/15, PWA 3/3 and flags-OFF 12/12 PASS. New proof/log hashes are in `docs/brand/takolio/v1/evidence/main-sync/`.

**Protected/exclusions:** 294 protected files and 425 old asset paths byte-identical to refreshed main; root tokens unchanged, two auth fallback display literals only, 25 protected legacy source-copy locations deferred. No main push, deploy, workflow dispatch, payment/Worker/migration/domain/flag/persisted-ID change. Legal, premium 3D, native/device and authenticated hosted/offline acceptance remain pending.

**Next:** finish feature integration commit/push, confirm draft PR mergeability, wait for automatic exact-head hosted `validate` and independent reviewer inspection of refreshed evidence. Owner review follows; no automatic merge/deploy.

# Takolio V1 native raster validation follow-up - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` until the automatic exact-head hosted `validate` succeeds. Draft PR #79 remains open: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79.

**Observed failure:** runs `38791694785` and `38791948359` passed lint/typecheck but failed one new brand test (8,469/8,470 passed). The test required committed macOS PNG pixels to exactly match native Linux SVG rasterization; `icon-512.png` differed by one RGB LSB. Same-toolchain double-generation hashes passed. Migration smoke and build were skipped by those failed hosted jobs; prior local results remain separate evidence.

**Correction:** test-only comparison retains exact same-toolchain SHA, committed manifest SHA, all non-PNG source bytes, dimensions/channels/decoded length and alpha. Cross-platform RGB differences must be at most one LSB in no more than floor(width * height * 3 * 0.0001) channels, with no minimum allowance for micro icons. Negative controls reject larger/color-density/alpha/geometry/micro changes. Generator, runtime artwork, application code and CI workflow are unchanged.

**Executed:** `pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS; focused brand suite PASS, five files / 50 tests. The earlier complete local suite remains 8,470 PASS; the added comparator guard is included in this focused run and the forthcoming hosted full run. See `docs/brand/takolio/v1/evidence/portable-raster.json` for log hashes and reproduction limits.

**Next:** independent review of this follow-up, push feature branch only, wait for its automatic hosted validation and owner review. No merge, deployment, dispatch or protected-system change.

# Takolio V1 draft published - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_IMPLEMENTED_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Local implementation, local QA and independent code/design/security review complete. Draft PR #79: https://github.com/lol-vn/Tako-san/pull/79. Hosted `validate` runs automatically from the PR; it is pending at this checkpoint and is not claimed PASS.

**Repository/branch:** `lol-vn/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`); `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`; live main remains `03428467cdd5e93d27a3a27e5edaf7d512eef71d`. Implementation `8e81d5d9879f6a8ea22db7cbc232fcf399a354fa`, independently reviewed source/evidence checkpoint `6ee9c8c4fff71a472383c39e9ce0d9f97be541c6`. This publication documentation checkpoint follows them.

**Actual actions:** GitHub CLI authenticated as `lol-vn`; feature branch push succeeded; PR #79 verified OPEN and DRAFT with base main. No merge, deployment, workflow dispatch or protected-system mutation occurred. Previous authentication failures below remain historical evidence.

**Next:** require successful exact-head `validate` and owner review; independently reviewed implementation has no open findings. Keep 25 protected-copy locations, legal clearance, premium 3D finishing and native/device exclusions explicit. No release action is authorized.

# Takolio V1 migration checkpoint - 2026-10-16 JST

**Status:** `TAKOLIO_V1_CHANGES_REQUIRED` pending authenticated push/draft PR and hosted `validate`; local implementation and independent review are complete.

**Repository:** `lol-vn/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`), baseline main `03428467cdd5e93d27a3a27e5edaf7d512eef71d`, branch `feat/takolio-brand-migration-v1`.

**Implementation commit:** `8e81d5d9879f6a8ea22db7cbc232fcf399a354fa`.

**Implemented:** canonical `TAKOLIO_BRAND`, compatibility facades, versioned `/takolio/v1` sources/runtime, deterministic Sharp generator, semantic tokens, Plus Jakarta Sans subset, public surfaces/metadata/PWA updates, protected old V3 fallback. Runtime manifest: 69 files / 478,874 bytes. ZIP SHA256: `d2f77b552c07570d846a20d2602dd3a6c41ebb4fd9c66328234bf86da8ca1142`.

**Verification:** lint/typecheck/migrations/audit/build ON+OFF/full 363 files and 8,470 tests/94 E2E/PWA/flags-OFF all PASS. Matched browser run retains one transient scan-review axe receipt and has a passing narrow recheck. Independent reviewer found no implementation findings.

**Protected:** no PayOS/payment/checkout/Worker/migration/infra/domain/OAuth/persisted-ID/flag changes. Twenty-five protected legacy product-copy locations remain DEFER. Legal clearance, premium 3D mascot, native stores/physical devices and hosted CI are pending.

**Next action:** review docs/evidence, authenticate `gh`, push branch and create a draft PR only; request hosted `validate` and owner review. Do not merge/deploy.

See `docs/brand/takolio/v1/{AUDIT,IMPLEMENTATION,VERIFICATION,ROLLBACK,ASSET_MANIFEST}.md` and `docs/brand/takolio/v1/evidence/`.

# T27 compact kitchen UI local checkpoint - 2026-10-16 JST

Verified implementation checkpoint: `34421382` (source/tests/ADR/task packet).

**Status:** LOCAL_COMPLETE / NOT_DEPLOYED. The compact UI/UX pass is implemented on
branch `codex/compact-kitchen-ux-20261015`; no production, staging or migration
operation was performed for T27.

**Product result:** Kitchen routes use a scoped compact density layer. Page titles,
section/card typography, repeated padding and panel chrome are smaller while text
inputs remain 16px and action targets remain at least 44px. The mobile header is
64px, scan keeps its accessible name, and `/plus` is excluded. Planner setup now
clearly separates auto whole-meal generation from a manual calendar, summarizes
saved habits, keeps allergy/forbidden-ingredient choices visible and reflects
Vietnamese meal structure. Favorites, shopping, recipes and onboarding use shorter
copy and clearer next actions. Shopping manual entry is a native disclosure that
preserves the user's open state and draft across responsive resizing.

**Verification:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, paired ON build, default build,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `git diff --check` and scoped Prettier all PASS. Family
Playwright E2E is 12/12 PASS across 320/390/768/1280 in 4.9m, covering manual
calendar, multi-dish servings, picker quantities, favorites, generated family
meals, shopping edit/reload and unknown-demand review/skip/reopen. Full Vitest
ran 362 files / 8,467 tests: 8,466 PASS and one timeout in the Wrangler local
migration-list test (5.326s execution against a 5s budget), exit 1. That file
passes 32/32 in isolation in 6.47s; this is a test-runner timing budget issue,
not a failed assertion. Logs and exact limits are in `docs/ai/tasks/T27-compact-kitchen-ux.md`.

**Browser proof:** Isolated preview manually checked at 320px and 390px/desktop.
Planner setup accessibility exposes Vietnamese contextual headings, meal structure
and safety summary. Shopping disclosure opens by Enter/Space, has visible focus,
keeps a typed draft and stays open through 320px -> 1280px -> 320px; no horizontal
overflow was observed. Final visual artifacts are in `.wrangler/family-meals/`.

**Limits/next:** Local synthetic preview does not certify hosted signed-in
behavior, native iOS rendering, 200% zoom or retention. Product/design review and
normal protected CI/staging/production release remain the next action if this
checkpoint is accepted.

# T26 planner repair deployed - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** DEPLOYED / AUTHENTICATED_HOSTED_ACCEPTANCE_NOT_TESTED. PR78 merged;
production serves `03428467cdd5e93d27a3a27e5edaf7d512eef71d`. The repair bounds
stalled requests/recovery and reduces repeated family-search work. This supersedes
the local-only checkpoint below; source implementation `063a026d` remains intact.

**Hosted gates:** exact-head CI38725963888, exact-main CI38727424674,
staging Deploy38728806704 and approved production Deploy38729311534 all SUCCESS.
All three full hosted suites passed362files/8465tests (556.32s/582.26s/375.79s).

# T26 family planner hang repaired locally - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** READY_FOR_RELEASE. Implementation commit `063a026d` on
`codex/fix-family-planner-hang-20261015`. Production still serves
`0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55`; no T26 deployment claim.

**Repair:** planner/profile/composition requests now stop waiting after30s through
transport and body reads, show uncertain-delivery recovery and preserve exact
retry keys. Changed family choices get a new key; uncertain profile saves are
read back before continuing. Late aborted responses cannot seed caches or clear
identity. Backend shares trusted immutable contexts, reuses exact slot pools,
filters family eligibility before caps and bounds/counts generated work.
Hard restrictions, quantities, locks, tenancy and schema0043 remain intact.

**Executed gates:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=2` (362 files/8465 tests,
429.67s), `pnpm check:migrations`, default and paired-ON `pnpm build`
all PASS. Final focused6files/46tests PASS. Native workerd/D1 authenticated
14-slot full-role week2118ms versus baseline9796ms; replay/one-plan/unchanged
stock/events PASS. Browser390/1280 actual transport/body stalls and exact retry
PASS4/4; timeout setup axe0 violations after narrow existing text-contrast fix.

**Retained failures:** initial full run failed3 discovered scratch suites and11
pre-existing macOS /var versus /private/var path/parser assertions. Scratch names
now use.proof; canonical TMPDIR isolated capture79/79 and full8465/8465PASS
without capture-code changes. Initial helper type and browser harness failures
are retained. Exact logs, timings and acceptance are in T26 task packet.

**Limits:** no hosted signed-in or production generation proof yet; CPU exhaustion
is a hypothesis. Sparse-stock42-slot case remains36complete/6unplanned as before;
another bounds fixture completes42/42. The work cap is heuristic, not CPU
certification. Retry keys last for the mounted setup; current-plan recovery is
available after navigation. Legacy flag-OFF Week requests remain outside scope.

**Next:** normal PR/exact-head and exact-main CI, staging deploy and supported
authenticated smoke, then protected production rollout with explicit d1/0 and
paired flags ON. No migration is needed. Catalog continuity sources/dependencies
are unchanged. Canonical GitHub repo is now `lol-vn/Tako-san` (same ID); old pinned
staging migration workflow names may skip after transfer, an unrelated follow-up.

# T25 Vietnamese family meals production certified - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_COMPLETE / PRODUCTION_CERTIFIED. T22-T24 is serving production
at `https://frigo.tungjpstore.net` from candidate
`0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55`; approved hardened SHA
`3a24808b97838235596a43694013e74b1ba64cc2`. Paired planner UI/server flags are
ON. Release certification uses automated checks and public smoke as requested;
authenticated hosted household flows remain NOT_TESTED.

**Verified sequence:** PR #75/#76 merged normally; exact-head `38626853404` and
exact-main `38628474378` CI passed 359 files / 8,442 tests with lint/types/
migration smoke/build. Staging migration `38629910072` and deploy `38630223689`
passed. Production migration `38630661149` applied exact 0042+0043, certifying
ledger 43/tip `0043_shopping_demand_review.sql`, healthy FK/quick checks, aggregate
drift none and family schema 28 objects/11 tables with constraints PASS.

| Production Stage | Run | Full Hosted Tests | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| shadow/0 | 38631551953 | 359 files / 8,442 tests, 456.63s | SUCCESS |
| canary/1 | 38633505550 | 359 files / 8,442 tests, 614.33s | SUCCESS |
| canary/5 | 38635714965 | 359 files / 8,442 tests, 589.04s | SUCCESS |
| canary/25 | 38642407644 | 359 files / 8,442 tests, 588.97s | SUCCESS |
| d1/0 | 38646724015 | 359 files / 8,442 tests, 565.46s | SUCCESS |

Every stage retained normal production Environment approval and passed protected
receipt verification. Each promotion joined the preceding candidate's exact
Worker/deployment IDs; final root/independent verification joined canary/25 exactly.
No rollback was used.

**Final serving receipt:** `work/t25-production-d1/release-manifest.json` and
`work/t25-production-d1/release-manifest.json.independent-verification.json`
certify Worker
`25b4008f-3444-4b48-b7e3-071dfc706664`, deployment
`f37b8645-44fd-4ab4-9975-494ef73a0238`, production D1
`f975ec39-b2c8-4a2a-80e1-0366054599d3`, ledger 43, paired flags ON, D1/0,
actual/global source D1, D1 ready, served 500 recipes, no fallback, release
`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, and fingerprint
`f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`.
Three exact asset/SW observations passed. Same-candidate paired-OFF recovery
`8c5b6928-8144-4eb9-8b61-b757c8ef35a2` is certified inactive with compiled
OFF assets; recovery traffic NOT_REHEARSED.

**Final public evidence:** `work/t25-production-public-adjusted-final.json` is
`PRODUCTION_PUBLIC_READINESS_ASSETS_SMOKE_PASS`, completed
`2026-10-14T22:35:43.049Z`. Exact production SHA, no-store auth shell,
`/assets/index-CRmh9668.js` with immutable cache, matching protected SW hash and
three consecutive ordinary/revalidated observations PASS. Final
`EXPECTED_RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE=d1` public smoke PASS. Database is ok, D1/500/
no fallback; readiness is degraded solely by informational
`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY` (`src/worker/config/validation.ts:149`),
which confirms the cutover fence is satisfied.

**Retained verification failures:** Original scratch public verifier failed twice
because Cloudflare Insights injects an external module and its single-module-count
assumption rejected the auth shell. Failed receipts
`work/t25-production-public-final.json` and
`work/t25-production-public-final-rerun.json` remain. The adjusted scratch verifier
requires exactly one bounded local `/assets` main module while ignoring external
module count, retaining exact SHA/cache/SW/authority checks; rerun PASS. This was a
verification-harness limitation; no runtime change or production incident was found.
Earlier CI timeouts, staging D1 column-limit failure and optional stale historical
receipt comparison remain preserved in prior checkpoints.

**Limits and closeout:** Authenticated planner/manual/favorites/shopping flows
NOT_TESTED; recipe-media R2 NOT_REVERIFIED; recovery traffic NOT_REHEARSED. Local
product tests are not hosted household acceptance or retention/user-research proof.
Source/runtime/config/schema were unchanged by this documentation checkpoint.
Root should publish the final four-document receipt checkpoint normally on the
receipts branch; no release gate or reviewer approval remains outstanding for T25.

## Prior Rollout Checkpoint - c622ee61

The current checkpoint supersedes the earlier canary/25 pending state. Historical
receipt evidence and limitations remain unchanged below.

# T25 canary/5 certified; canary/25 awaiting approval - 2026-10-15 JST

**Hosted verification:** Canary/5 full suite PASS: 359 files / 8,442 tests,
589.04s (`work/t25-production-canary5-full.log`). Earlier shadow 456.63s and
canary/1 614.33s counts/evidence remain preserved. User selected automated checks
and public smoke; authenticated hosted household flows remain `NOT_TESTED`.

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS (`RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS`). Serving candidate remains
`0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55`, with approved hardened SHA
`3a24808b97838235596a43694013e74b1ba64cc2`. The previous receipt documentation
checkpoint is `e8c79dd7`; earlier CI/staging/migration/shadow/canary/1 evidence is
preserved below.

**Canary/5 completed:** Run `38635714965` SUCCESS after Environment approval.
Root and independent verifier PASS for
`work/t25-production-canary5/release-manifest.json`; the prior Worker/deployment
joins exactly to certified canary/1. New Worker
`28e28d93-2e95-4779-a624-bd054cbad5be`, deployment
`6f064c1d-cac7-40e6-a241-18e64a6237c8`, binds canonical production D1.
Receipt certifies exact candidate/hardening, ledger 43/tip 0043, paired flags ON,
transition canary/1 -> canary/5, configured canary 5%, actual D1/global mixed,
D1 ready, served 500 recipes, protected fingerprint
`f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`,
no fallback and three asset/SW observations. Same-candidate paired-OFF recovery
`5aad31a7-a186-43f8-9456-0339f669f9ea` is inactive and certified with compiled
OFF assets; recovery traffic was not rehearsed and rollback was NOT_USED.

**Canary/5 public smoke:** `work/t25-production-canary5-public-smoke.log` PASS
with approved canary mode, exact SHA and three ordinary/revalidated SW observations,
correct shell/SW/immutable asset cache, database ok, canary 5%/mixed and 500 recipes.
Readiness remains degraded at canary; the authority notice is informational as
recorded in `src/worker/config/validation.ts:149`. No authenticated household flow
is claimed.

**Active gate/next:** Canary/25 run `38642407644` passed its release job and is
WAITING for `vn-taphoanhatung` at the protected production Environment. Actual
approval, upload, receipt and smoke are pending. After approval, require exact
predecessor join to canary/5 IDs above and the same SHA/hardening/paired flags,
ledger/catalog/Worker/assets/SW and stage-specific public smoke. Then request d1/0
only after canary/25 certification; final D1/500/no fallback/exact SHA/SW/no rollback
proof remains outstanding. Root may checkpoint docs on the receipts branch;
remote main stays `0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55` until final rollout
certification. Source/runtime/config/schema are unchanged; no final release claim.

## Prior Rollout Checkpoint - e8c79dd7

The following entries preserve their recorded state; the current checkpoint above
supersedes the earlier canary/5 approval and deployment claims.

# T25 canary/1 certified; canary/5 awaiting approval - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS (`RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS`). Immutable candidate remains main
`0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55`; approved hardened SHA remains
`3a24808b97838235596a43694013e74b1ba64cc2`. User selected automated checks and
public smoke; authenticated hosted household flows remain `NOT_TESTED`.

**Completed source, CI, migration and staging gates:** PR #75/#76 merged normally;
exact-head `38626853404` and exact-main `38628474378` passed 359 files / 8,442
tests with lint, types, migration smoke and build. Staging migration
`38629910072`, staging deploy `38630223689` and production migration `38630661149`
passed at the exact SHA. Production is ledger 43/tip 0043 on D1
`frigo-db` / `f975ec39-b2c8-4a2a-80e1-0366054599d3`, with healthy FK/quick check,
16 production aggregate fields drift-free, 500 recipes/fingerprint and family
schema constraints PASS; staging separately certified 103 aggregate fields.
Post-migration public smoke of the previous Worker at approved hardened SHA PASS
(`work/t25-production-postmigration-oldworker-smoke.log`): database ok, D1/500/
no fallback and exact SHA/SW convergence. This public coexistence check does not
certify authenticated household flows.

**Shadow receipt:** Run `38631551953` and independent verification passed. Its
hosted full suite passed 359 files / 8,442 tests in 456.63s
(`work/t25-production-shadow-full.log`). Shadow proved paired UI/server flags ON,
ledger 43, served 500 recipes and protected fingerprint
`f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`,
Worker `3739abf9-b7a5-421e-8c25-ea1069bebbf2`, deployment
`f2ffb0e5-b84d-4b5f-91ae-df6ef345a1eb`, canonical DB binding and three asset/SW
observations. Same-candidate paired-OFF recovery `fd637894-0fd3-4017-89cf-729de28ef477`
was certified inactive with compiled OFF assets; no rollback or recovery traffic.
Fresh shadow readiness/smoke was status/database `ok`, shadow/0, global `static`,
500, no fallback and no warnings.

**Canary/1 receipt:** Run `38633505550` and
`work/t25-production-canary1/release-manifest.json.independent-verification.json`
passed. Its hosted full suite passed 359 files / 8,442 tests in 614.33s
(`work/t25-production-canary1-full.log`). The verifier joined exactly to the shadow
Worker/deployment, then certified transition `shadow -> canary-1`, configured
canary 1%, actual source D1, global source `mixed`, D1 ready, served 500 recipes,
the protected fingerprint above, ledger 43, and no fallback. Canary Worker is
`bb35e2cc-f6fe-4fc0-84ee-284b8440bfe9`, deployment
`10c00336-861c-4077-8f3a-3355701c2bc1`, with the expected DB binding and three
asset/SW observations. Its same-candidate paired-OFF recovery
`86fe3947-73dd-4610-9b34-cf94fef4b570` is inactive and certified; rollback was
`NOT_USED` and recovery traffic was not rehearsed.

**Canary/1 public observation:** Fresh readiness at `2026-10-14T20:53:52.993Z`
returned HTTP 200, exact SHA, production database `ok`, canary 1%, mixed source,
500 expected recipes and no fallback. Status was `degraded` with warning
`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY`. Source `src/worker/config/validation.ts:149`
defines this as the informational canary/D1 authority notice with the cutover
fence satisfied; it is not a fatal configuration or failed release gate. Canary/1
hosted public smoke passed. Retain the exact warning in later observations.

**Active gate:** Canary/5 run `38635714965` passed its release gate and remains
WAITING for reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` at the production Environment gate.
The reviewer request is pending; user intent to approve does not replace the actual
GitHub approval. No canary/5 upload, receipt or smoke is certified yet. After
approval, verify the exact canary/1 predecessor join, same candidate/hardened SHA,
ledger/catalog, Worker/binding, assets/SW and public readiness before canary/25
and d1/0. Preserve additive 0042/0043 and fail-closed recovery; final release is
unverified until d1/0.

**Historical receipt limitation:** Optional comparison with artifact `38274253206`
failed on IDs predating authorized post-release secret operations. Protected release
gates passed, and root verifier without this stale optional comparison PASS.
Shadow's actual previous Worker `ded100e7-98ae-4c83-aab5-94342daa06a3` /
deployment `56b74111-0bf8-44db-ac79-a15e28f80f27` matches preserved payOS
acceptance. Later receipts must join immediately preceding candidate IDs exactly.

**Documentation checkpoint:** Source/runtime/config/schema remain unchanged.
Root may commit and normally push these four documents on
`codex/family-release-receipts-20261015`. Remote main must stay
`0ff82edb7c251be340b5e00fbcf0ae8703b22a55` throughout the rollout; do not merge
this documentation branch into main until final deployment/receipt/smoke pass.

# T25 staging D1 column-limit correction - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; product source merged, staging migration stopped
before mutation. PR75 merged final head bdb5014d67b3b13688db1746bd07c3c5b5bacd5c
as main a07b308c6997947c59a9e5f6ecf715b6b1eb573a. Exact-head CI38581755662
and exact-main CI38583565990 both PASS: 359 files / 8,440 tests, respectively
589.91s and 592.25s; lint/types/migration smoke/build PASS. Merge tree equals
reviewed head and preserves ancestry.

**Hosted failure:** staging migration38585376230 attempt1 at main a07b308c
failed during pre-health. Identity pinned to frigo-db-staging-v3 /
7854298a-20f5-46aa-9cbf-917079c2a3dd, complete ledger41/tip0041 and Time Travel
bookmark were certified. Actual bookmark step PASS; failure followed generated
baseline SQL. Apply step was SKIPPED; no application deployment or production
migration/deploy occurred. Redirected remote stdout was not uploaded, so its exact
error text is unavailable. Sanitized receipt remains in scratch.

**Cause and narrow correction:** baseline SQL returned103 columns, above D1's
SQLITE_LIMIT_COLUMN100. The exact SQL deterministically fails with SQLite CLI
column100 (`too many columns in result set`) and passes with103. Official
Cloudflare limits and workerd SQLite security setup confirm100. Split only the
aggregate query into84+19 columns, preserving all103 counts across83 legacy tables
and catalog/media diagnostics. Strict parsing and persisted-baseline validation
retain fail-closed drift/identity/ledger/schema/CI gates. No product/runtime,
applied migration, auth/payment, dependency or production configuration change.

**Verification:** focused migration/workflow checks PASS: 4 files / 70 tests
(6.55s), including 12 direct family-migration regressions. Full lint, scoped
ESLint and diff check PASS. Independent review found no actionable issue.
Native Wrangler4.149/workerd local D1 reproduced the old103-column SQLITE_ERROR;
new84+19 results PASS, with all103values equal to0041 and0043 references.
Only an isolated local D1 received43migrations. New exact-head and exact-main
hosted CI remain required before staging retry.
User chooses automated checks/public hosted smoke; authenticated product flows
remain NOT_TESTED. Existing production reviewer vn-taphoanhatung is required.

**Next:** verify narrow correction; normal PR/merge and exact-main CI; run staging
migration/deploy/smoke at the resulting immutable SHA; then protected production
0041->0043 and shadow0->canary1->5->25->d1/0. Preserve previous receipts, all gates
and additive schema on recovery. No production-success claim.
# T25 hosted CI timeout correction - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; PR75 final candidate CI retry pending.
Commit2ffebf44 remains the verified release-tooling baseline. Hosted CI38579146408
failed only three 5-second timeouts in scoped-picker quantity integration tests:
8,437 passed / 3 failed, 358 files passed / 1 failed, total8,440 tests/359 files.
The failing cases took5.215-5.272s; nearby green multi-request cases took4.5-4.8s.
An isolated unchanged local rerun passed28/28. The fixture replays43 migrations,
500 recipes and several Worker requests; comparable functional fixtures use30s.

**Correction:** scoped30-second test deadlines on the three functional suites in
`t20-scoped-picker-quantity.test.ts`. All assertions and separate evaluation/query/
pool/performance-bound tests remain intact; no runtime or global CI policy change.
Focused picker and performance checks run before the follow-up commit. Previous
full local8440PASS remains recorded; final exact-head hosted CI must pass.

**Authorization:** user chooses automated checks and public hosted smoke; no
signed-in hosted household product acceptance is claimed. No remote migration or
new deployment has happened. Existing Environment reviewer gate is preserved.

**Next:** push the narrow correction and actual focused evidence, require successful
exact-head CI, normal merge/exact-main CI, then staging and protected production
sequence in tasks/T25-family-meals-production-release.md.

## Prior Checkpoints

# T25 family meals production release - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; local release tooling verified. User authorizes
gathering T22-T24 and releasing production. Branch
`codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013`; PR https://github.com/hello-tako/Tako-san/pull/75.
Source baseline d64ba0c9; product checkpoints 6b63606d / d3952c34 / cf54910f.
Active packet `tasks/T25-family-meals-production-release.md`; accepted ADR-061.

**Delivered:** bounded current-main staging 0041->0042->0043 migration/certification;
production current-main/CI fences and exact family schema proof; post-media catalog
support for 0042/0043; inactive same-candidate paired flags-OFF recovery with exact
Worker/D1/catalog and live HTML/module byte-hash verification. Active UI is rebuilt
and paired flags verified before upload. Schema remains additive on rollback.
No payment/auth runtime, dependency, production config or applied migration edits.

**Executed:** final full `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=2` PASS,
359 files / 8,440 tests (423.70s, `work/t25-full-tests-final2.log`). Lint, app/Worker
typecheck, migration smoke, default and paired flag builds PASS. Migration focused
7/172, production exact-schema addition 3/30, composition/recovery focused 2/54
PASS; diff checks and independent read-only release reviews PASS. T24 local
browser12/12 and workerd/D1 HTTP8/8 remain product evidence, not hosted acceptance.

**Failures retained:** initial full run 8,438 passed / 2 failed: inherited Wrangler
5-second startup timeout (isolated32/32 PASS unchanged) and obsolete one-build-only
workflow assertion. The assertion now checks every allowed explicit paired build
and recovery/active guard ordering. Final full rerun passed every test. Logs stay
in scratch `work/`; `node_modules` and `work/` are not committed.

**Hosted boundary:** initial PR CI38574007006 passed at old head d64ba0c9; final
candidate CI, exact-main CI, staging migration/deploy and protected production
receipts remain pending. No remote migration or new deployment has occurred.
Public readiness reports prior production/staging SHA
3a24808b97838235596a43694013e74b1ba64cc2, D1/500/no fallback. Its prior production
receipt38274253206 provides the already-approved hardened_sha. Re-read active
version/ledger through new pipeline; do not copy historical IDs.

**Next:** push this checkpoint, require exact-head CI and normal ancestry-preserving
merge, exact-main CI, staging migration/deploy at D1 with paired flags ON, then
protected production migration0041->0043. Production restarts shadow/0 with explicit
rollback confirmation, promotes sameSHA canary1->5->25->D1/0, verifies each receipt.
GitHub production Environment reviewer vn-taphoanhatung remains required. No gate
bypass or production-success claim. A used recovery must prove served OFF assets;
no live recovery rehearsal occurred. Aggregate preservation is not byte-content/R2
proof. Authenticated hosted family flows need an existing certification session.

## Prior Checkpoints

# T24 unknown shopping demand review - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** LOCAL_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFIED. Branch `codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013`.
Implementation commit `cf54910f5ebf64293517b855f0da6cbe0f8f9582` follows verified T23
implementation `d3952c34b1c217fb695cd551a247c0882c4c01d7`. Accepted ADR-060 and
expand-only migration `0043_shopping_demand_review.sql` are included. No push,
merge, remote migration or deployment was performed.

**Implemented:** unknown shared shopping demand now has a snapshot-bound review
contract. A member can choose a positive purchase amount/unit, skip only this trip
snapshot, or reopen a previous decision. The selected purchase is stored as buying
intent and never changes the recipe demand (which remains NULL), recipe coverage,
physical inventory, or bought history. The list shows the unknown total separately,
known source contributions per meal, collapsed source details, independent recipe
links, explicit Vietnamese actions, and truthful offline/pending/error recovery.
Shared members review the persisted list without opening another member's private
planner. Immutable idempotency receipts, full demand/review/purchase witnesses,
monotonic revisions, household membership checks and atomic D1 batches protect
concurrent edits. Deleting an unchecked reviewed purchase reopens review rather
than creating an indefinite same-plan dismissal; checked history remains separate.

**Verification:** Node `v25.9.0`, pnpm `10.33.2`.

- `pnpm lint` PASS (including final post-label run).
- `pnpm typecheck` PASS for app and Worker; final labels run recorded in `work/t24-typecheck-labels.log`.
- `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=4` PASS: 357 files / 8,386 tests (`work/t24-full-test-final-frozen.log`).
- Focused T24 suite PASS: 7 files / 98 tests (`work/t24-focused-final-frozen.log`); explicit UI label suite PASS: 2 files / 13 tests.
- `pnpm check:migrations` PASS; `pnpm schema:check:local` PASS with migration tip 0043; local D1 apply/HTTP smoke PASS (8/8, including stale 409, replay, skip/reopen, bought history, delete reopen and SQL invariants).
- `GIT_COMMIT=local-t24-shopping-review pnpm build` PASS and paired planner/composition-flag build PASS (`work/t24-build-default-final.log`, `work/t24-build-paired-final.log`).
- `PORT=3101 PREVIEW_API_PORT=8891 pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.family.config.ts` PASS: 12/12 at 320/390/768/1280 (`work/t24-family-browser-final2.log`); screenshots reviewed at phone and desktop widths.
- `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`, `git diff --check`, protected-path/source receipt checks PASS. Frozen receipt covers 18 changed source files and 61 protected files unchanged.

**Failures retained:** the earlier full suite had one Wrangler 5-second timeout
(8,385 passed); the later frozen-source full run passed all 8,386. An early
workerd HTTP DELETE returned 409 after a successful cascade delete; actual D1
`meta.changes=3` proved the exact-one guard wrong, and the positive-count guard
plus regression/HTTP rerun fixed it. Earlier browser runs retained 11 passed/1
navigation timeout and 7 passed/5 failed (four incorrect assumptions that more
than one unknown demand must exist, plus one ERR_ABORTED while source edits were
in progress). The final test exercises one demand through its full lifecycle;
no workspace edits ran during final2, which passed 12/12. Earlier checkbox and
ReactNode/test-typing failures are retained; explicit labels/locators and final
lint/type/UI/browser checks passed. The 8,386-test full run preceded the final
label-only markup refinement; the subsequent 13 UI tests, typecheck, lint,
12-browser matrix and both builds cover that final refinement.

**Release boundary and limits:** apply migrations 0042 and 0043 before a Worker
serves shopping traffic, including when planner flags are OFF; retain additive
0043 tables on rollback. The current T24 Worker with paired flags OFF is covered
locally. Binary rollback to T23/pre-T24 is not certified after reviewed purchases:
the older delete path can create legacy dismissal and the older UI cannot review,
skip or reopen. Local workerd/D1 and browser fixtures are synthetic, not hosted
acceptance, nationwide Vietnamese user research, regional provenance certification,
clinical nutrition/allergy safety, retention proof, or production release.
Unknown package/bunch/piece mass, leftovers/shared prep, vendor allocation and
future-only whole-week regeneration remain outside T24.

**Next action:** separately authorize normal PR/exact-head CI, migration-first
staging and hosted smoke before any release. Keep payment/auth/infrastructure,
dependencies, applied migrations and remote data outside this task.

# T24 unknown shopping demand review - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS. Branch codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013.
Base T23 verified implementation d3952c34b1c217fb695cd551a247c0882c4c01d7;
documentation743752b68652d41fd0a67f0e7e67fa93e4e46fd5. Active packet
 tasks/T24-unknown-shopping-demand-review.md. Accepted ADR-060 adds an explicit
purchase amount, exact-trip skip/reopen and revisioned command receipts.

**Scope:** Unknown demand remains unknown; selected purchase intent is separate.
Existing shared/manual shopping, stock separation, household tenancy, immutable
replay and optimistic witnesses remain authoritative. New migration0043 must
precede shopping Worker release independently of planner flags; applied migrations,
payment/auth/infrastructure/dependencies stay outside this task.

**Verification:** Pending implementation and sequential focused/full gates, local
D1 apply/schema and real browser synthetic app/Worker HTTP checks. No push, merge,
remote migration or deployment authorized or executed. No claim of nationwide
research validation, clinical safety or improved retention.

**Next action:** Finish local implementation/race and UI verification, update this
checkpoint with actual counts/failures and commit coherent source/documentation.
Historical checkpoints remain preserved.

# T23 fridge quantities, manual selection and continued-week shopping - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** LOCAL_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFIED. Branch
codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013. Base T22 documentation checkpoint
c465bd1baf94246b8a591d07971343c245ad424a. Verified implementation checkpoint
d3952c34b1c217fb695cd551a247c0882c4c01d7. Active packet tasks/T23-quantity-aware-manual-planning.md;
accepted architecture ADR-059, extending ADR-058. No push, merge, remote migration
or deployment. Local evidence is not hosted or production acceptance.

**Implemented:** intentional persisted empty manual calendars; explicit add versus
named replacement from recipes/saved dishes; canonical role selection; exact
required/from-fridge/missing amounts at destination servings; earlier meals and
shared ingredients reserve stock once; downstream no-buy/cook-now consistency;
locked selections survive assisted completion. Manual complete_meal mains use a
one-dish template for that slot; ordinary family dinners retain their groups.
Discovery/detail/calendar/cooking links retain servings; uncertain/offline cooking
attempts freeze count and deductions. Fractional measured stock entry/correction
uses exact compatible unit display conversion and original draft revision fences.
Shopping keeps explicit purchase edits and retires only successful command keys.

**Integrity and compatibility:** scoped picker snapshots bind plan/loaded revision,
slot/date/type/servings/replacement and current inputs, including elapsed-slot
identities; later reads cannot authorize a calculation from an older revision.
Numeric sequence breaks equal-time ties consistently. Membership and atomic
inventory/profile/catalog fences remain. Strict existing family/V1 response keys
are retained; richer quantities require opt-in assessments. Source cache seeds
are refreshed before quantities can be selected. Corrective removal stays possible.

Future V2 meals remain editable after earlier meals elapse. Current projections
skip elapsed instants rather than reserving current stock for them again. Shared
family shopping can recalculate future demand after inventory/history/time changes;
profile/hard preference/catalog/authority staleness still blocks it, and freshness
remains truthful. Trip defaults/minimum use the saved plan offset, including late
same-day meals when the device's date differs. Time is captured at request start.
Legacy price optimization, V1 swapping and whole-week regeneration retain strict
past-horizon gates; individual future meals can be edited/completed. No calendar,
shopping generation or checkbox deducts physical inventory.

**Executed gates:** Node v25.9.0 / pnpm 10.33.2. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`
(both projects), `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=4`
(354 files / 8,332 tests,232.84s), `pnpm check:migrations` (42 migrations),
`GIT_COMMIT=local-t23-family-planning pnpm build`, and
`GIT_COMMIT=local-t23-family-planning VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true
VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED=true pnpm build` PASS. Audit
`pnpm audit --audit-level=high` PASS, no known vulnerabilities; dependency/config/
migration bytes unchanged by T23. Focused backend 38 tests and latest UI/calendar
150 tests PASS. Final typecheck confirmed by root. `git diff --check` and protected
path/source review PASS. Full tests/browser/builds ran sequentially; no combined
`pnpm check`, hosted CI or production success is claimed. The later E2E-only URL
matcher fix did not change runtime or the full unit/integration test graph.

**Running-app evidence:** `PORT=3101 PREVIEW_API_PORT=8891 pnpm exec playwright
test -c playwright.family.config.ts` 8/8 PASS (3.5m),320/390/768/1280. Actual
browser/app/Worker HTTP uses synthetic catalog/SQLite D1 fixtures without business
API interception in family flows. Manual calendar, servings, exact rice320g,
add/replace/completion/one-dish reload, shopping3->7->3 and changed-stock continuation
are verified. Inventory stays unchanged by these planning/shopping actions. Axe
and horizontal-overflow assertions PASS in tested surfaces; screenshots visually
reviewed. `PORT=3104 PREVIEW_API_PORT=8894 pnpm exec playwright test -c
playwright.t20.config.ts` 42/42 PASS (3.7m),390/768/1280. Its negative load/fallback tests explicitly
intercept selected responses. Targeted recovery/fallback 6/6 PASS (32.9s). These
local Chromium fixtures do not certify hosted workerd/D1, real users or retention.

**Failures retained:** earlier full T23 run exposed three inherited inventory UI
conversion expectations, fixed with unit-only versus explicit correction semantics.
Preview login stalls showed Vite504 Outdated Optimize Dep (zustand); concurrent
Vitest/browser attempts were interrupted (exit130), followed by isolated runs.
One earlier build was interrupted after Vite and is not a pass. Legacy T20 fixture
helpers needed actual cuisine/role, idle-state and optional price-panel interactions.
Final compatibility attempt retained 2failed/1interrupted/20passed/19notrun (exit130):
load/fallback interceptors omitted the new includeAssessment query. Matching the
exact pathname and proving an actual failed read fixed the cause without weakening
assertions; targeted6 and final42 then PASS. Missing test imports/router fixture
shape in early continuation checks were fixed; failures/logs remain retained.
Independent final review found the trip device-date mismatch, fixed with actual
payload/minimum and midnight regressions. No remaining confirmed review finding.

**Database and limits:** T23 adds no schema/migration. T22's0042 remains required
before releasing any Worker route using family/profile/favorites/shared-shopping
storage, including planner flags OFF; preserve additive schema on rollback.
No new remote/local D1 apply is needed for T23. Unknown shopping demand has no
purchase/resolve/dismiss command; manual entries do not reconcile it. No guessed
package/bunch/piece mass, leftovers/shared prep/multi-vendor allocation, independently
verified all-catalog regional provenance or clinical nutrition/allergy certification.
No future-only whole-week regeneration and no proven retention improvement.
Research distinguishes Hanoi qualitative evidence, public guidance, product decisions
and implemented behavior. Source/log/screenshot receipts are in the calling chat's
outputs/t23-verified directory; scratch work/ and node_modules are not committed.

**Next action:** separately authorize normal PR/exact-head and exact-main CI, then
migration-first staging and hosted smoke of both planner flags before protected
production release. Product follow-up: define an explicit unknown-demand review
contract, validate regional metadata and run a multi-region household diary/task
study. Keep payment/auth/infrastructure/config/dependencies/applied migrations
outside this task. Historical checkpoints follow unchanged.

# T22 Vietnamese family meals - 2026-10-13 JST

**Status:** LOCAL_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFIED. Branch
codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013; base
332a24f468d5360b6cefc57b9451228585457131. Implementation checkpoint
6b63606d97bb2c9009d620c18c3d91aec76d4870. Active packet tasks/T22-vietnamese-family-meals.md;
accepted architecture ADR-058. No push, merge, remote migration or deployment.

**Implemented:** whole-week Vietnamese-first family lunch/dinner compositions;
breakfast/quick/one-pot templates; revisioned member meal habits wired into
schedule/servings/regions/time/cuisine and shopping cadence; private saved recipes
and picker; per-dish swap/lock/save; current-composition truthful board/composer;
trip-scoped shared shopping with exact compatible demand, familiar fraction display,
collapsed source dishes, purchase edits, offline receipt overlays, mutually exclusive bought/cannot-buy,
dismissal and original command replay. Mobile list precedes manual entry.
Physical inventory remains unchanged by generation/shopping/checking.

**Integrity and compatibility:** sequential whole-week stock projection;
current inventory/expiry/storage/profile/ranking/catalog witnesses guard
computed planning, proposal, composition and shopping-materialization writes
atomically; explicit profile/favorite/manual shopping commands use their own
membership and revision guards; strict V1 read shape retained; paired-flag-off V1 writes reject
stored family plans without optional-schema reads. Locked foreign mains reserve
rolling seven-day allowance, including future preserved slots; lowered cap warns
without removing choices. Companion repetition is soft across the horizon,
staple repetition allowed. Hard time is all-component prep+cook; unknown time is
visible. All-unplanned hard-time requests return valid strict DTOs. Onboarding
hydrates saved household size without replacing an explicit local selection.

**Executed gates:** Node v25.9.0 / pnpm 10.33.2. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`
(both projects), `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=4`
(347 files / 8180 tests), `pnpm check:migrations`
(42 migrations), `GIT_COMMIT=local-vietnamese-family-meals pnpm build`, and
`GIT_COMMIT=local-vietnamese-family-meals VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true
VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED=true pnpm build` PASS.
`pnpm audit --audit-level=high` PASS; dependencies unchanged.
Local `pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply frigo-db --local` and
`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm schema:check:local` PASS; ledger 42 through 0042.
`git diff --check` and protected-path/migration checks PASS. No combined
`pnpm check`, hosted CI or production success is claimed for this branch.

**Running-app evidence:** `pnpm exec playwright test -c
playwright.family.config.ts` 4/4 PASS at 320/390/768/1280 with actual app/Worker
HTTP and synthetic SQLite/catalog fixtures, no API interception. Axe zero on
board/composer/favorites/shopping; no horizontal overflow in tested flows.
Actual local workerd/D1 on 8794 (catalog=d1, AI off) independently created 7/7
four-role dinners, 0 partial/unplanned/generated international meals, materialized 20
shopping demand keys (3 unresolved / 17 known items), retained 777.5 purchase quantity,
bought/cannot-buy and favorite count 1 across reads; inventory unchanged. Local receipt
and fresh browser screenshots copied to the calling chat's outputs/implemented-app.
This is local synthetic evidence, not hosted smoke or user retention validation.

**Failures retained:** an early full run had 16 failed files / 55 failed tests,
including UI/provider/capture compatibility failures. A later run identified
role-distribution and schema-gate hash failures; reviewed seven-recipe role delta
and expand-only 0042 pin fixed them, with focused regressions. First mid-edit root
typecheck failed an unknown `search.limits` guard; explicit object narrowing and
final both-project pass followed. One workerd attempt restarted during an active
request; later frozen-source run PASS. Early macOS temp-path capture failures
require TMPDIR=/private/tmp. A concurrent build failed with "Service Worker build
token was not found" and a concurrent browser attempt showed a blank page before
the Language control. Their root cause is unproven. Final isolated default and
paired builds exited 0; final isolated Chromium was 4/4 PASS in 1.2 minutes.
Earlier passing counts (8137/346 and 8161/346) remain historical; final source is
347 files / 8180 tests. Failed logs remain retained and are not reported green.

**Limits/release order:** regional preference uses existing catalog metadata;
not every regional attribution is independently verified. No clinical nutrition,
assumed package/piece mass, parallel-cooking estimate, or full-week preview/apply
workflow. Direct regeneration has explicit confirmation. Apply 0042 before this
Worker serves any traffic, even planner flags OFF, because shopping/favorites/
profile routes use new tables independently. Retain additive schema on rollback;
paired flag-off on current guarded Worker is the locally tested rollback path.
A pre-T22 Worker after family plans exist is not certified for rollback.

**Next action:** independent review of this checkpoint, then separately authorized
normal PR/exact-head and exact-main CI, migration-first staging, paired flags and
hosted smoke before protected production release. Keep payment/auth runtime,
config/dependencies/protected workflows and old migrations unchanged.

**Delivered:** shared UI navigation; owner-only billing account, package status,
expiry/renewal, latest20 transactions and persisted pending QR recovery after
reload. Atomic owner admission blocks duplicate outstanding orders across keys,
tabs and old clients. Session fences protect account changes. Guests see login
CTAs for registered-only Home/Planner. Verified paid/lost-create-response race
allows renewal; other uncertainty remains blocked. Issued prices stay frozen.

**Actual acceptance:** after protected release, admission enabled on both Workers.
Production temporary monthly2000VND offer was issued by the real authenticated
app. QR decoded/CRC/fields matched, payOS initially PENDING/0. Closing modal,
reloading and opening history restored the same order/instructions with no new
history row; source resume path does not create a provider order. Owner performed
the real bank transfer. Provider PAID/amountPaid2000/reference-present verified;
owned live history shows paid and Plus active after reload with expiry
2026-11-12T18:31:14.000Z, consistent with 31 days from the free/null baseline.
No manual grant, fabricated settlement callback or agent bank transfer occurred.

**Restoration/security:** deleted production PAYOS_TEST_MONTHLY_PRICE_VND secret.
Fresh Worker metadata confirms absence; authenticated UI confirms monthly49000,
annual499000, paid2000 history and the same Plus expiry. Staging never received
the price override. Admission/payOS secrets retained. Callback security matrix

# payOS billing account, QR recovery and temporary offer - 2026-10-13 JST

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED; hosted checks and new protected
staging/production release remain pending. Branch
codex/payos-billing-account-20261013 starts at production b7358ea4 (PR73).
Explicit owner authorization covers this payment work, protected production
release and temporary monthly2000VND; canonical monthly49000/annual499000 remain
source defaults. No new migration, auth policy or release protection change.

**Implemented:** GET billing/account returns a no-store owner snapshot of current
entitlement/expiry, recent20 payment records and an all-history outstanding fence.
The Plus UI adds package management, renewal, truthful history and owned saved-QR
reopening after reload. Session-generation/owner fences discard late responses
and retained callbacks. Loading/error blocks new creation. Atomic D1 admission
prevents concurrent different-key and unkeyed duplicate orders; same-key replay
retains original persisted amount and instructions. Remote uncertainty remains
blocked for reconciliation unless the payment is already verified paid with its
persisted provider reference; that rare lost-create-response race no longer
blocks renewal. Legacy QR instructions were never saved and are not
fabricated; old pending orders wait for expiry if no transfer was made.

**Guest follow-up:** planner-enabled Home and Planner show an explicit login CTA
for guests, skip registered-only reads and fence retained authenticated callbacks;
server guest403 and legacy Week behavior remain intact.

**Checks:** backend focused4files/170tests PASS including actual workerd/D1;
UI/service focused, owned ESLint, both TypeScript projects, whitespace and billing
contract generation/check PASS. Final `GIT_COMMIT=local-billing-account-preview
TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm check` PASS:338files/8055tests, lint/types/migration-smoke/
build, followed by a separate paired planner/T20 build PASS. Running-app synthetic
fixtures verified desktop1280/mobile390 without horizontal overflow; free, active
Plus/expiry/renewal, pending reopen, legacy unavailableQR, expired, read-error and
guest Planner states match expected UI. No fixture dispatches provider/mutations.
First full attempt failed due scratch review tests accidentally discovered and
legacy planner fixtures inheriting globalT20 build flags; scratch preserved outside
repo and V1 fixtures now explicitly isolate flags, with trueT20 tests retained.
Static Plus rendering also needed a fail-closed browser session capture guard.
No new live UI or2000VND offer is claimed yet; deployed source remains b7358ea4.

**Next:** normal PR/main CI,
protected staging then production deployment. Verify exact assets/runtime/D1,
then enable CHECKOUT_ADMISSION_ENABLED and PAYOS_TEST_MONTHLY_PRICE_VND=2000.
Create/reopen a true2000VND app QR; owner performs transfer. Confirm real provider
payment, persisted paid intent and Plus expiry before deleting the temporary
price secret to restore49000. No fake payment or direct entitlement grant.

# payOS / Plus shell production checkpoint - 2026-10-12 JST

**Status:** PRODUCTION_OPERATIONAL; paid-settlement acceptance and follow-up
registered-planner guest UI correction remain pending. PR73 merged as
b7358ea4146226a929aa1e20513c2f98f77b7092. Hosted main CI38260918278 PASS:

38262309375 and production38262862169 PASS on attempt1, with actual production
reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. Immutable artifact ID, pre-upload-only retry, process
cleanup and strict service-worker proof preserve existing release protections.

**Live evidence:** Both exact runtime/asset SHA proofs PASS, Worker100%, matching
origins/D1, paired planner/T20true, D1 authority500/no fallback. Three payOS keys
retained. Production checkout secret activation succeeded after proof. Both
callback matrices PASS signed200/invalid401/malformed400/oversized413/unauth401.
Actual production app monthly intent113018856588681 yielded a decoded/CRC-verified
49000VND QR matching visible instructions; providerGET PENDING/amountPaid0.
No transfer, fake paid webhook or direct grant. Owner may perform paid acceptance.
Production readiness HTTP200/config/db/queueOK retains informational
CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY warning; it is not a failed service.

**UI:** Plus was excluded from the shared kitchen shell and deliberately selected
legacy navigation. PR73 fixes authenticated/guest Plus, 5-item nav/top Scan,
scoped white hero headings and route comparison case/trailing-slash consistency.
All actual App routes audited; only intended auth/landing/onboarding/immersive
exceptions remain. Production mobile Plus verified visually with real QR.

**New follow-up:** Guest Home with plannerON calls registered-only current-plan
API and shows a generic403 error. This pre-existing issue also affects production
because planner/T20true is preserved. Separate branch
codex/guest-home-planner-20261012 is correcting the Home/Planner guest boundary
and login CTA without weakening server403. Final source, checks and release
receipts must be recorded after that correction is deployed. Temporary private
credential files remain for final verification; cleanup not yet complete.

# Admin V1 R1 certification review - 2026-10-14

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_R1_CHANGES_REQUIRED (local review of 0331cc9/25140ba; reviewer
is the same agent that implemented R1, so not independent and no PASS possible).
Report: docs/admin/reviews/2026-10-14-r1-certification.md (+ r1-certification/
evidence and reviewer tools). No source change, push, deploy or remote access.

**Re-verified (clean worktree of 0331cc9):** full vitest 342 files/7865 tests
exit 0; lint/typecheck/build exit 0; customer dist/client byte-identical to
186a9cf (441 files) and identical Worker dry-run bundle; check:migrations ok;
migration matrix 11/11; implementer workerd checks 108/108; independent workerd
probe 1169/1169 (production positive control, 12 negative variants, real browser
on workerd, customer Worker parity); reviewer tests 18/18; original PoCs 51/51
before, 22/29 after with 0 unexplained; E2E 11/12 (axe 0, overflow 0) — the one
failure is a flaky keyboard-scroll assertion (product verified correct).

**Findings:** P1 F1 admin Worker has a writable binding to the production
customer DB and reads password hashes every request (needs read facade); P1 F2
two-SUPER_ADMIN governance deadlock without break-glass; P1 F3 no identity-bound
production bootstrap ceremony. P2 F4-F11: decider TOCTOU, non-atomic bootstrap,
pre-auth account lockout, full-scan aggregates, flaky E2E, E2E rewrites tracked
screenshots, deep-link charset, Access sub binding.

**Next:** fix F1-F3 (+P2), then a genuinely independent review; production stays
blocked on Access staging, admin workflows and the ceremony.

session-derived CSRF (no cookie), no CORS, two-person bootstrap, four-eyes
SUPER_ADMIN grant+revoke, DB minimum two, credential-change session revocation,
audit-before-disclosure, per-IP/account/global login limits, UI P1 fixes.

**Verification (clean worktree of 25140ba):** full vitest 342 files/7865 tests
PASS (exit 0); lint, typecheck, build PASS; check:migrations (customer + admin
smoke) PASS; admin vitest 10 files/133 tests; real workerd check 6/6 scenarios

# Takosan Admin Console V1 local implementation - 2026-10-12

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_LOCAL_COMPLETE (local only; not deployed, not production-certified).
Implemented separate admin frontend (`admin/index.html`, `src/admin/`), Worker admin
API (`src/worker/routes/admin/`, `/api/v1/admin/*`), shared RBAC/DTO contract
(`src/shared/admin.ts`), additive migration `0042_admin_console_foundation.sql`,
local-only fixture/provision/preview tooling (`scripts/admin-*.mjs`), and docs in
`docs/admin/` (API reference, RBAC matrix, security assessment, migration report,
integration plan, local setup, screenshots). ADR-ADMIN-001 records the authority model.
No GitHub/Cloudflare remote operation, deployment, remote migration or payment-code change.

**Verification (local, exact):** pnpm lint PASS; pnpm typecheck PASS (both projects);
pnpm build PASS (dist/client/admin/index.html + unchanged `index-*` customer entry);
pnpm check:migrations `migration-smoke=ok` incl. 0042 assertions; wrangler `--local`
D1 fresh replay 0001-0042 and 0041->0042 upgrade PASS; admin integration 30/30,

MIGRATION_LEDGER and pass on re-run (2 files/189 tests). Full suite not re-run after that
test-only fix.

**Compatibility edits:** customer service worker skips `/admin*`; rate limiter gained
optional `key`; `MIGRATION_LEDGER` + migration smoke include 0042. Production workflow
migration allow-lists and `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json` intentionally unchanged.

d1/canary0/plannerT20true preserved. No extra migration or protection change.
Temporary credentials remain private pending final setup verification.

**New failure and correction:** Authenticated production issuance returned502.
Actual workerd reproduces TypeError before outbound provider work because
redirect:error is unsupported at the edge. Node-only no-transfer tests had
passed and missed this runtime difference. The adapter now uses redirect:manual;
existing non-2xx rejection prevents following redirects or forwarding credentials.
Seven actual-workerd regressions fail before the fix; focused fivefiles/138tests
PASS after it, including redirect301/302/303/307/308 and forged-signature rejection.
Both PAYOS_CHECKOUT_ENABLED secret flags setfalse while replacement is prepared;
callbacks remain available. Checkout admission stays OFF independently.

**Next:** Finish local/full/hosted checks, normal PR/main merge, deploy staging,
verify actual app issuance, then protected production replacement with reviewer
approval. Enable and verify only after exact deployment. Owner-controlled bank
transfer and persisted Plus acceptance remain unverified; no fake grant or real
money movement. Historical checkpoints below are superseded by this entry.

# Nine-region production release preparation - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** RELEASE_PREPARATION. Active packet
../backend-upgrade/nine-region-production-release/PLAN.md. User separately
requests production upgrade; protected release/migration authorized. OTP/provider
paid tests remain unauthorized, AI budget USD0. Offline checkpoints0407011d/d8699437
remain preserved. Release branch codex/nine-region-production-release.

**Changes:** Checkout admission has a default-off exact Worker capability;
UI preserves no-key legacy checkout while disabled, keyed requests fail closed.
Recovery reads are disabled without opt-in. PayOS signatures/prices/pending-only
grants unchanged. Scanner workflow moved to a preserved non-executable YAML
candidate pending independent promotion, no protection/check bypass. Added staging
0041 identity/exact-main/ledger/bookmark/constraint certification workflow. Extended
production0041 exact-main/constraint checks and explicit post-media tip without
relaxing catalog/media integrity. 0040 bytes/config/dependencies/deploy unchanged.
See ADR-RELEASE-001 in the release packet.

**Checks/failures:** Verification in progress. First focused run235behavior tests
PASS but new workflow-test quote syntax failed; first fullcheck failed generic
Zod input/output inference. Both fixes applied; new complete gates in progress.
No current-SHA PASS or new live deployment claimed yet. All old receipts retained.

**Database/deployment:** Production last separately verified0c0f9933/ledger40.
0041 rollout must precede app deploy and preserve old-worker coexistence; no
remote mutation/new release executed yet. Environment reviewer vn-taphoanhatung
required; CLI hello-tako. Never change protections or reapply0040.

**Next/limits:** Finish local gates/browser/scanners, protected PR/exact-main CI,
staging0041/deploy/smoke, production0041 and deploy with separate Environment
approvals, then receipt/monitor. All nine external acceptance rows remain
PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE; checkout/security/AI/data/VNext remain dormant as
specified. No real OTP, paid AI or live payment testing. Original checkout
preserved. Historical entries below remain immutable.

**Local verification:** pnpm check PASS: 330 files / 7705 tests,166.03s;
lint/both TypeScript projects/41-migration replay/build PASS. Remote gates
explicitly skipped. Focused migration checks18/18 PASS. Full/prod dependency
audits0. Source scan4865 files: Semgrep/zizmor0; Syft504 declaredcomponents;
Gitleaks raw17/exit1 retained, exact-context17matched/0unresolved. Eleven
protected appliedmigration/provider/grant/price/config/lock/deploy paths exact.
All four baseline failure logs retained: plan-capability expectation, quote
syntax, Zod inference and exact workflow migration-list expectation. Browser
attempts preserve port collision, dev-preview empty document and service-worker
interception bypass/401; final mock tests explicitly block service workers.
Public PWA remains a separate deployed check; no actual OTP/provider/payment call.

**Release scope/next:** checkout admission default OFF and scanner workflow
non-executable candidate; real acceptance remains PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.
Push normal PR and wait exact-head then exact-main CI; staging0041/deploy/smoke
before protected production0041/deploy/monitor. No production mutation yet.


Final local browser acceptance PASS in both modes: Chromium/Firefox/WebKit at
320/1440,12 cases/24screenshots, zero stable axe/overflow/broken/page-errors or
external requests. Default-off calls no recovery API or idempotency header;
opt-in keeps key/reload replacement fence/GET resume. Actual new checkout remains
OFF in staging/production configs. Stable enabled-button opacity resolved the
transient WebKit contrast capture; failed evidence remains retained.

# Integrated backend and Brand V3 production release - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** PRODUCTION_VERIFIED_WITH_EXTERNAL_ACCEPTANCE_OPEN.
Repository hello-tako/Tako-san, immutable ID 1385308553. PRs 66, 67 and 68 are MERGED.

/Users/tunbee27/.codex/worktrees/backend-b00-baseline/frigo. This documentation
checkpoint records the verified release source; it is not a new runtime release.

**Delivered/evidence:** Backend integration, Brand V3, Tailwind 4.3.3 compatibility,
strict OTP recovery and exact-main migration fences are on production. PR68
preserves only the unchanged complete D1 authority, with verified 22 source blobs. Main CI
38208731783 PASS. Local/hosted suite 320 files / 7650 tests PASS; 94 isolated
production-build E2E PASS; 198 responsive screenshots have 0 axe/overflow/broken

Pinned Semgrep/zizmor 0; Gitleaks raw 17 context-reviewed / 0 unresolved, raw status
retained. Approved deploy 38206476316 FAILED before any Worker upload; retained.
Protected payment/billing sources are unchanged. Synthetic invoice/fridge
fixtures remain TEST_ONLY. Earlier failed attempts remain recorded.

**Database/deployment:** Staging migration 38204668457 and deploy 38209289078 PASS;
production migration 38205975841 PASS from 6bc1fe96; final deploy 38209910253 PASS.
Migration source/schema bytes are unchanged in the new deployed SHA.
Actual GitHub approvals for BOTH production runs: vn-taphoanhatung; protections
unchanged. D1 ledger 39 -> 40, only 0040 applied; FK [], quick_check ok, aggregate
drift none, six strict OTP tables/two indexes/constraints PASS; private rollback
bookmark retained. Active production Worker 820c79ef-2db1-4016-95e8-afad9d61958f, 100% traffic;
canonical D1/catalog 500, exact fingerprint, d1/cutover true/canary 0/T20 paired true.
Certified inactive strict OTP recovery a300e28d-d304-4dcb-a256-b2495befe72c; metadata/flags/binding
verified before traffic. No live activation/rollback rehearsal occurred.

**Deployed checks:** Staging and production each pass 30 read-only checks, including
18 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit public page cases at 320/1440, exact brand bytes,
unauthenticated tenant guards, release-specific PWA cache upgrade and offline shell.
Production monitoring: 11 observations across 301.163s,
all exact-SHA database/queue/catalog/configuration checks PASS. Runtime status is
`degraded` solely for CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY, the deliberate complete
D1 cutover warning; no other issue was accepted. These are bounded
observations, not a seven-day SLO certificate. Routed WebKit empty-response failures
and controls retained. New staging smoke1 image timeout and smoke2 undefined
callback failure are retained; smoke3 passes. Exact transport cause unconfirmed.

**Limits/next:** Direct production WebKit Turnstile iframe errors remain recorded;
rendering smoke does not certify challenge solve/authentication. Real inbox delivery remains unverified (deliveryVerified=false);
live OCR/provider accuracy/budget, independent ingredient/data acceptance, physical
old devices/browser floor, protected billing acceptance and load/chaos/SLO remain
open. Dormant provider/V3 writer/Ingredient V2 candidates remain unpromoted. Use
final-local-completion/release-receipt.json, RESULT.md and validation.json for run
links, receipt hashes, recovery instructions and actual scope. No paid calls/mail/
financial transactions were made. Original checkout unchanged. Next work requires
the specific missing provider/data/owner inputs in OPEN_ACCEPTANCE.md.

# Production catalog continuity preflight fix - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** FIX_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_FULL_VALIDATED; normal PR/main CI and a new

6bc1fe96527bf111958b870f66b47f4e0c5ea2fd CI38204233535 PASS.

exact strict schema, FK/quick_check PASS, aggregate drift none; bookmark retained.

**Failure/source:** Approved deploy38206476316 FAILED during transition preflight
before recovery upload/application upload/traffic change. Current production remains
652e0d7632745e9b77cda4b5b3caac83a3ec1015; migration0040 remains applied. The guard
requires new application SHAs to reset D1 rollout to shadow, despite unchanged fully
verified catalog authority. Failed run/approval/receipt retained privately.

**Change:** ADR-CATALOG-CONTINUITY-003 narrows production d1->d1 continuity to a
complete healthy protected authority proof, active previous100% version, canonical
binding/flags/commit, ancestor source, identical22catalog kernel/dependency blobs
and unchanged Zod specifier/resolution/integrity. Trusted workflow supplies the
version evidence; no input bypass. Canary/source/catalog drift remains rejected.
Previous authority proof is retained only for bounded edge convergence retries;
old-SHA responses are never final deployment evidence. Runtime/catalog/payment
sources unchanged by this fix. Branch codex/production-catalog-continuity.

**Checks/next:** Targeted3files/301tests and full320files/7650tests PASS. Lint,

Legacy auth still invalidates on false and clears resend KV cooldown; across-request

**Executed:** Input 83/83 digest/safety/dimensions; reproducible 49 exports; runtime 54
files / 269090 bytes; glyph/weight/license hashes. Full Vitest 289 files / 6749 tests PASS
with canonical local TMPDIR and 2 workers, no waiver. Types/full lint/local migration
smoke and both paired-flags builds PASS; focused brand 6 files / 68 tests PASS.
Production-build E2E 82 PASS / 4 failures: baseline ambiguous status selector H and
source-import instrumentation E unsupported in production, both repeated on baseline.
Auth resend/expiry 8 PASS. BEFORE 198 / AFTER 198 renders across 320..1440, zero final axe/
overflow/broken images/navigation clipping; supplemental 15 states / 2 journeys, 12 Week-off,
3 PWA checks PASS. Performance 3 cold/warm pairs / 3 routes, font transfer reduced, JS bundle
near unchanged, CLS Home~0.01765, zero measured domain writes/inventory unchanged.

**Failure disclosure:** Earlier full test run hit /var-vs-/private/var, missing
historical Git blobs and existing Wrangler 5s timeout; environment repaired and full
passed. Default dev preview bootstrap failed before app; production alternative
used real local cookie/Worker. Dependency audit existing 16 high / 2 critical, no package
changes; needs separate remediation. Heuristic UX script advisory FAIL; changed UI
manually checked against guidelines and dynamic a11y evidence. Not field CWV/device/
real Google login/email delivery/provider payment/native/screen-reader certification.

**Database/deployment:** Only synthetic in-memory local fixture mutations. No
remote credentials/secrets/migrations/deploy/production mutation or approval bypass.

**Next:** Review PR with actual final hosted CI, resolve baseline test/dependency
issues in scoped tasks, then owner-authorized staging/cache/device verification.
Do not infer production release authorization from local checks. Preserve other
open operational-doc PR histories when merging the prepend entries.

# UI04 — Luồng quét và review đã kiểm chứng local — 2026-10-10 JST

**Task/status:** `UI04_LOCAL_VERIFIED_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Tiếp tục rebuild Tako-san
trong phạm vi packet `docs/ai/tasks/UI04-scan-review.md`, ADR-047. Milestone local
hoàn tất; toàn bộ hệ thống và bộ nhận diện cuối vẫn còn các hạng mục trong roadmap.

**Repository/source:** Canonical `vn-tak/Tako-san`, ID1385308553, base

Implementation đã kiểm chứng và commit `85b86442257ae9573701c2df6107cd5e509cdade`.
Documentation checkpoint theo sau; checkout Frigo cũ giữ nguyên.

**Actual changes:** Scan → review → sửa → explicit confirm → inventory dùng cùng
ReviewHeading/Summary, ReviewFields, source preview gắn đúng scan ID và responsive
kitchen-scan CSS. Pine/coral/warm canvas và Be Vietnam Pro giữ identity prototype;
camera workspace riêng, review có navigation. Desktop hai cột, mobile một cột,
input16px/48px, 8 đơn vị, short viewport dùng action trong document flow. Camera
fallback thư viện, tips details và chọn ảnh khác sau lỗi. Không còn timer giả
queue/AI/validation; upload đang gửi, pending/processing theo DTO. Reduced motion
và status announcement không đọc elapsed mỗi giây.

Accepted fields kiểm tra tên/lượng hữu hạn >0≤10000/ngày trước programmatic submit;
blank không thành0/1. Dòng photo rejected disabled và gửi ID+rejected để server giữ
evidence gốc. Offline synthetic import bỏ rejected, validate toàn bộ accepted
quantity trước mutation, import0 không báo pendingSync, giữ expiryEstimated và
UNKNOWN/KNOWN/ESTIMATED projection.
Photo pendingSync có feedback, khóa sửa/confirm; rời review xóa queued ready draft
trong đúng session/scan, quay lại hydrate trạng thái máy chủ. Camera effect dừng
đúng stream và late response; đổi mode/new image hủy image read, reset input cho
chọn lại cùng file. Source ảnh chỉ memory và bind đúng ID từ upload response;
không tự nhận ảnh cũ khi hydrate. Receipt ingredient lookup đúng rawName/canonical.
Raw AI/OCR, confidence0/unknown, giá/ngày mua, quota/retry, ownership/session,
conflict/refetch, inventory revisions/idempotency và Week shortcut giữ contract.

Main CI `37851106419` SUCCESS, 259files/6361tests; CI green vẫn bỏ sót
fixture defect dưới đây. Nhánh sửa riêng `codex/t20-fixture-schema-contract`.

**Finding/fix:** P1 staging certification: fixture SQL dùng `datetime('now')`,
vi phạm CHECK `updated_at IS strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', updated_at)` của
migration0021. Test cũ dùng bảng tối giản không có CHECK nên bỏ sót.
Sửa đúng một expression thành UTC ISO `strftime(..., 'now')`; không đổi migration,
policy values, bindings, workflow guards, auth/runtime hoặc production data.
Thêm4 regression chạy prepare/audit với full migration chain bằng SqliteD1,
kiểm chứng timestamp, stored policy, insert1, audit0, duplicate prepare reject,
stock/event snapshot không đổi và FK check. Auth records trong tests chỉ là local
SQLite fixtures; workflow remote vẫn chỉ nhận normally registered verified owner.

# Production scan telemetry recovered; bounded validation repair candidate - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout remains INCOMPLETE. Frozen deployed source/main
is `0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`; shadow Worker
`f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b` remains shadow/0%/cutover false,
global static, T20 false. Migration 37689543237 APPLIED only0039 and certification
37693128721 PASS. No canary dispatched; never replay0039 or recovery37536969564.
Operator excludes user-data retention certification because no real users exist.

**Confirmed telemetry:** The operator completed separately scoped Cloudflare API
MCP OAuth, including telemetry-query permission. Bounded `dry=true` queries retrieved
four scan events and seven events from the same invocation, verified against account
hash, Worker version, service, 50-second window, support hash `b6db841cbed9`, request
and trace IDs. OCR attempts1/2 on qwen-vl-ocr each returned SCHEMA_VALIDATION,
611 output tokens; escalation attempt3 on qwen3.8-flash returned INVALID_RESPONSE,
2 output tokens. This supersedes the previous log-access blocker. Schema fields and
escalation parsing branch were not logged; equal token counts do not prove equal
content. The original scan/fixture bytes remain missing and the scan was not replayed.

**Candidate changes:** On `codex/ai-scan-validation-diagnostics`, propagate only
fixed schema field paths and Zod codes (deduplicated, maximum8) into existing bounded
scan repair feedback and `ai_usage`; emit fixed invalid-envelope/empty-content/
unparseable-content/empty-items stages. Revalidate the diagnostic allowlist at Worker
logging. Unknown field names, item indexes, Zod messages/received values and raw
provider content are excluded. Public error codes, validation/quality gates, provider
models, token/call limits, queue fencing, payments and auth are unchanged. This fixes
lost actionable schema feedback and missing diagnostic precision, not a proved live
receipt-schema root cause. No live provider success is claimed.

**Checks:** Initial regression import failed before module creation; with a no-op
module, all6 regression assertions failed as expected. Initial focused6files/87tests
PASS. Final focused9files/109tests PASS4.75s, including adversarial log redaction,
bounded/deduplicated paths, repair prompts, provider stages and queue retry/fencing.
Final `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, migration smoke and build PASS. Full suite
with Node24/TMPDIR=/private/tmp/CI=true/maxWorkers2:255files PASS/1failed,
6315tests PASS/1failed348.06s; the unchanged local Wrangler staging-startup test
exceeded its5s timeout. Isolated unchanged rerun32/32PASS3.31s, actual Wrangler
case1099ms. No full local PASS is claimed. Source/release self-review found no
remaining concrete issue; it is not independent review. Public provider success
still requires new-release validation. Implementation checkpoint `648dbd32010363712f219d25ca0b5109db37c3d3`.
No production write, Worker change or new scan occurred in this diagnostic continuation.

**Checkpoint/source:** Detailed evidence and continuation:
[Production shadow diagnostic](scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).
The former documentation checkpoint is `a29af19`; credentials/raw telemetry remain
ignored under `.wrangler/production-evidence/20261008`. Do not publish raw logs,
account IDs, receipt data or OAuth tokens. R2 bytes and email delivery remain unverified.

**Next action:** Finish checks and source review, normal PR/exact-head CI/merge and
exact-main CI, then revalidate the frozen new source through protected deployment
and a distinct non-PII provider validation. Original failed scan must not be replayed.
If validation still fails, use the new correlated diagnostics to isolate a smallest
justified fix. Only a passing provider gate permits production1/5/25/D1, each with
normal independent Environment approval. No review bypass or migration replay.

All preceding checkpoints below are historical.

# Production shadow verified; AI diagnosis blocked on historical logs - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout INCOMPLETE. Frozen release/main is
`0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`, exact-main CI `37686743768`
SUCCESS. Migration `37689543237` APPLIED only 0039; read-only certification
`37693128721` PASS; production shadow `37763248411` SUCCESS. Each received
normal independent Environment approval by `vn-taphoanhatung`. No canary run
has been dispatched. T20 server/UI remain false; user-data retention certification
is excluded by the operator's instruction.

**Actual production:** Worker `f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b`, deployment
`7f2f522f-c9cf-4762-9022-3435ae7e6e38`, shadow/0%/cutover false/global static.
Schema 39, 500 hydrated recipes, zero hydration failures, 500 valid ready media;
FK clean and quick_check ok. Three new public readiness/service-worker pairs
PASS through `2026-10-08T11:48:52.379Z`: exact source/assets, healthy DB/queue,
config OK, no fallback. Shadow's hosted gates passed 255 files / 6309 tests
(438.75s). Email delivery and current R2 object bytes remain unverified.

**AI blocker:** One synthetic scan on this shadow release was accepted 202 and
ended FAILED / INVALID_RESPONSE / queue attempt 1 / max 3 / items 0, support hash
`b6db841cbed9`, at 10:41:55-10:42:33 UTC (19:41:55-19:42:33 JST). Logout was 200.
Its original fixture/receipt bytes disappeared during session interruption.
Recovered conversation history is explicitly labelled and cannot certify original
receipt bytes or accuracy. Do not resubmit this scan. No confirmed live root cause
or new AI behavior change: malformed envelope, empty content, unparseable content
and empty items can share this code; queue attempt 1 can include multiple provider
calls. Historical `ai_usage` and `scan_terminal` are needed before selecting a fix.

**Recovery/checks:** Re-downloaded all six GitHub candidate/receipt ZIPs; verified
API digests, archive provenance, exact extracted JSON bytes, run/attempt/SHA/CI,
normal approvals, and cross-receipt catalog/media/ledger/Worker invariants.
Account identity matched the certified hash after successful restricted CLI login.
One bounded historical log query (frigo only, 50 seconds, dry=true) was rejected
HTTP 403 / API 10000. Official endpoint requires Workers Observability Write;
OAuth has only account:read/workers_tail:read/offline_access. No scope expansion,
new provider submission, database write, Worker change or Environment bypass.
Original operator wrappers/control receipts and staging private packet are missing;
previous observations remain historical, not newly reverified executable evidence.

**Checkpoint/source:** This documentation stays on `codex/post-media-rollout-evidence`,
separate from frozen production main. Implementation remains reviewed `df2347ca`,
merged via PR58/main `0c777203`. Previous local test/hash-pin and concurrent build
failures are preserved below; no new full local suite is claimed for this docs edit.
Detailed digests, executed recovery commands and restart instructions:
[Production shadow diagnostic](scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).

**Next action:** Obtain sanitized historical `ai_usage` + matching `scan_terminal`
metadata via Cloudflare Logs for the window above. The restricted CLI received 403;
operator was asked to provide metadata, without credentials or receipt content.
Then isolate the cause, add a meaningful regression and the smallest justified fix,
normal review/CI/merge and validation of any changed final source before a distinct
provider validation. Promote 1/5/25/D1 only after the provider gate passes. Never
replay migration 0039 or recovery `37536969564`, or bypass Environment review.

All preceding checkpoints below are historical.

7350e86740d246ace03ddb0bd86de522025d03d5 exactly matches independent reviewed
complete tree. Draft PR58 is open. Production remains old healthy static136cb6ff;
ledger38/0038 and recoveryAPPLIED. No production mutation/deploy/provider scan.

**Changes:** Complete0038/0039 catalogs require19 safe aggregates, valid active
hero coverage and actual domain metadata; historical pending-only gates remain.
Generic verification and 0039 preflight validate immutable0035 schema definitions.
The preflight privately reads all18media columns, validates actual rows through
the real mapper/auditor and recomputes coverage/uniqueness. It binds the rowcount
and full metadata/schema SHA256 before migration; post0039 must preserve them.
Only aggregate counts/digests are uploaded. No runtime/config/applied migration,
dependency/credential/Environment policy or protected payment/auth change.

**Review:** Two independent reviews report no remaining concrete blocker after
fixing stale aggregate acceptance of a newly invalid private row. Source review
and actual CLI controls PASS. This proves persisted metadata and observed
non-atomic preservation, not fresh R2 bytes. ADR042 records these limits.

**Executed checks:** Node24 focused5files/98tests PASS40.23s; core migration114/114

No assertion or mutation guard is removed; full local PASS is not claimed.

**Build:** An initial build run during active Vite loaders failed the existing
service-worker token guard; retained log records that failure. After all test/CLI
loaders exited, the exact same build command PASS serially without source changes.
Concurrent output mutation is the observed limitation, not an application repair.

# Post-media migration gate repair - 2026-10-08 JST

**State:** Production release is incomplete. Normally approved read-only diagnostic
37681758263 completed with an intentional catalog gate rejection. Independent
actual artifact/API audit PASS: five ZIP digests and extracted bytes, exact main
282e564faaa7c608fa5617f65bb48d453d8e2fcd, successful CI37680537546 and normal
reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. The final main fence and sanitized uploads succeeded.
No production mutation occurred. Ledger remains38/0038; recovery37536969564 is
APPLIED and must not be replayed.

**Confirmed cause:** Runtime PASS proves500 recipes,0 hydration failures and
fingerprint f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37.
Catalog order0..499, IDs/slugs, provenance, ingredient/step/order coverage and
repeat-capture stability PASS. The old gate rejects media_ready=500 and
recipes_without_pending_hero=500 because it encodes the historical pre-media
rollout condition. These counts do not yet prove per-recipe ready hero coverage,
valid metadata or current R2 bytes. The earlier missing-pending hypothesis is
superseded by this actual evidence; no ready media reset/delete is authorized.

**Decision:** ADR-042 preserves historical pending-only seed/catchup gates and
adds fail-closed operational media checks only for complete0038/0039 catalogs.
Require active hero coverage, closed vocabulary/identity/version, exact ready
key/MIME/dimensions/hash/length, no orphan or duplicate ready role. Guarded0039
must preserve a private ordered full metadata capture by count/SHA256 across the
additive migration. Receipts publish only aggregate counts/hashes. This is metadata
and preservation proof, not a fresh R2 object-byte verification.

**Staging:** Source282e shadow37681762795 and canary1%37682153382 SUCCESS,

Current main282e and frozen release identity were rechecked before dispatch.
Local full-suite failures remain documented in the preceding checkpoint; hosted
full-suite success does not change that recorded local limitation.

**Prior production diagnosis:** Normally approved37616546408 SUCCESS proves500
physical/hydrated V1 recipes, zero hydration failures,2702matching ingredient/order
rows and stable observed non-atomic snapshots at ledger38/0038. It does not prove
live full runtime fingerprint, complete ordered IDs/slugs or pending hero/media
invariants. Missing0039 in that diagnostic's baseline is expected and does not
explain the preflight failure of migration37615237481. Recovery is alreadyAPPLIED;
no replay, blind migration retry or rollback followed.

**Implementation:** Reviewed3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d adds sanitized
read-only preflight diagnostics with unchanged catalog/runtime verifiers, complete
38-prefix ledger fencing, repeated successful snapshots and fixed error enums.
Failed queries cannot reuse stale JSON. Only safe aggregates/counts/hashes are
published. The final main fence executes after rejected diagnosis. Runtime,
config, migrations, credentials, dependencies and Environment policy are unchanged.

**Local investigation:** The exact historical recovery plan was recompiled from

e5a58960baa4b8e1f4cae8be94985dd03cf4e9acf03c274b38fb310ce79f28c0.
Four local controls PASS: recovery preserves recipe_media, so missing/duplicate
pending heroes can survive an APPLIED V1 catalog with500hydrated recipes and exact
runtime fingerprint while verifyCatalogAtTip rejects it. Runtime order is restored
from1000..1499 to0..499 by the same plan. This is a source/local hypothesis only;
live media state still requires the new protected read-only diagnostic.

**Preparation:** Fresh local-only pinned282e catalog source proof PASS:769source

# Catalog preflight diagnostic implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Production diagnostic
37616546408 completed SUCCESS at 2026-10-07T12:17:44Z on main
969d1d3735b85913c9b1dfe6ae4df2eba40e98b6 with normal independent approval by
vn-taphoanhatung. Five actual artifact ZIP digests and extracted JSON bytes PASS
in independent audit. Ledger stays 38 / 0038; 500 physical and hydrated recipes,
0 hydration failures, 2702 ingredients and matching order rows, exact historical
V1 ingredient lines/positions and stable observed non-atomic snapshots are proven.
The missing 0039 diagnostic baseline is expected and does not explain migration
37615237481's catalog preflight failure. T21R-B fingerprintVerified proves the
target V1 source, not the live full runtime fingerprint. Live ordered IDs/slugs,
media invariants and full runtime fingerprint remain unproven. Recovery is already
APPLIED; no recovery replay, blind migration retry or rollback is justified.

**Changes:** Implementation 3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d, tree
c79bda74d06d7b0637eb034b3057e2df1eecf636, adds a read-only catalog preflight
receipt to the existing protected diagnostic workflow. The helper reuses unchanged
verifyCatalogAtTip and verifyRuntimeCatalogContent at exact ledger 38, requires
repeat successful catalog/runtime captures and an unchanged complete ledger, and
reports independent PASS/REJECTED/NOT_EVALUATED checks. Only 13 numeric/null
aggregates, counts, hashes and fixed reason enums are uploaded; raw rows and
exception messages stay private. Failed captures cannot reuse stale JSON. Stable
non-atomic consistency is claimed only when ledger and both snapshot comparisons
PASS. The final main fence runs even after a rejected diagnostic. No production
write, runtime/migration/config/dependency or Environment-policy change.

**Verification:** Final helper tests 38/38 PASS under Node 24.16; final exact
Node 22.23.3 focused tests 3 files / 58 tests PASS (35.73s). Independent final
review of implementation/tree reports no remaining finding. Actual CLI controls
7/7 and exact workflow-shell stale JSON/provider-failure controls 5/5 PASS, with
0 production calls; official Node 22 CLI controls 4/4 PASS. Final lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, script
syntax, actionlint 1.7.12 and diff checks PASS. Default local full suite returned 3 failed
files / 12 failed / 6186 passed (179.65s): untouched capture tests compare
uncanonical macOS /var temp paths with real /private/var paths, and the local
Wrangler prefix test timed out under default concurrent workers. No tests were
weakened. Independent focused3files/125tests PASS4.58s with canonical TMPDIR
and maxWorkers=2; the two capture files reproduce the same11 failures with the
uncanonical default TMPDIR even with two workers. All eight involved source/test
files are byte-identical between969d and the implementation. Exact resource
bottleneck of the concurrency-sensitive Wrangler timeout was not profiled. Full
canonical-TMPDIR/maxWorkers=2 regression completed 253 passed / 1 failed files,
6197 passed / 1 failed tests (328.71s). The remaining unchanged local Wrangler
catchup test took33.993s and timed out at its existing5s bound; it passed1.745s
in focused verification. All new38tests passed in both full runs. Draft PR57
CI37624949372 is pending; no local full-suite PASS is claimed.
One actionlint invocation used a nonexistent certify filename; corrected to the
actual production-certify.yml and all four affected release workflows PASS.

**Production:** Public readiness at 2026-10-07T12:53:19.214Z remains healthy old
Worker 136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f / static / 0% / cutover false,
config OK and database OK. No new provider smoke submitted. Staging969d completed
its full shadow/1/5/25/D1 proof; that packet cannot certify a future main SHA.

Raw runner-local production rows were not exported or published.

**Next:** Finish the CI/environmental diagnosis and documentation checkpoint,
require final-head hosted CI on draft PR57, then normal merge and exact-main CI. Freeze the new main SHA and run
one normally approved protected read-only diagnostic to identify the rejected
catalog/runtime check. Repair only proven defects, then certify final-source
staging, guarded0039 and production schema/catalog before T20=false production
shadow, one synthetic provider smoke, canary1/5/25 and D1. Normal independent
production review remains required per run. User-data retention certification is
excluded by operator instruction. Do not claim production completion yet.

# Production preflight stopped; staging verified - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release is incomplete. PR #56 merged normally as

complete-tree equality 7c0cecd8e06657c570f5ce161cc5430ab8d9cd56. Final-head CI
37613292017 and exact-main CI 37614255604 SUCCESS; hosted main ran 253 files /
6,160 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build. Release source stays
frozen at 969d1d.

**Migration:** Run 37615237481 was approved normally by vn-taphoanhatung and its
frozen-toolchain/exact-SHA gate passed. Production identity and ledger 38 / 0038
were verified, then Require healthy current catalog before migration 0039 FAILED.
Bookmark, baseline, plan, apply and every post-check were SKIPPED; this run did
not apply 0039 or upload a Worker. No recovery replay or catalog rollback followed.
Both candidate/receipt artifact ZIP digests and extracted manifest bytes PASS in
root and independent audit. The sanitized receipt lacks the specific preflight
failure reason and raw query outputs, so the cause remains UNKNOWN. Prior inspect
APPLIED proves recovered rows/shape/counts, not complete runtime/media release proof.

**Reproduction:** The actual failure manifest plus fresh immutable 0038 V1 local
SELECT evidence passed the same verifier and exact four-argument CLI under
Node 24.16.0 and independently checksum-verified official Node 22.23.3. Both report
500 recipes, 0 hydration failures and fingerprint
f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37.
No argv, serialization or Node-version failure reproduced. These fixtures do not
certify live D1 and do not justify a blind migration retry.

**Staging 969d:** Completed shadow 37615155277, 1% 37615530432, 5% 37615915508,

imported detail (15 fields, 6 ingredients, 5 steps) PASS via 3 readiness guards /
5 GET requests. Final Worker b7b0a495-d933-4698-950c-a8d0918b20c4. Root independent
offline packet, archives and previous-authority progression audit PASS. A temporary
root assertion initially expected previousDeployment in staging; staging records
previousRecipeAuthority, so the assertion was corrected to that actual schema
before PASS. This certifies staging only.

GitHub API currently reports WAITING, approvals [], required production reviewer
vn-taphoanhatung and CLI current_user_can_approve=false. Normal review is requested;
do not bypass or change Environment settings. Read the new runtime, order, lineage
and V1-comparison receipts to isolate the preflight failure before choosing a repair.
Do not infer live hydration or media state from a successful local replay.

**Production:** Public readiness at 2026-10-07T11:50:46Z reports healthy old Worker

certification, shadow, provider smoke, canary 1/5/25 and D1 remain required after
the failure is resolved. Keep T20 server/UI false in production and preserve normal

# Production migration gate toolchain - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Protected inspection37611067522
verified the prior catalog recovery APPLIED at ledger38, so no recovery replay or
catalog rollback followed. New migration37612433689 failed in its credential-free
source gate:ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for the top-level TypeScript import in
scripts/d1-migration-check.mjs. Migrate was SKIPPED; no new D1 write or Worker upload.
Main remains5b12ab71acd84beec62be967c950b12d596c88d7 while the small fix is reviewed.

**Change:** Branch codex/migration-gate-toolchain adds pinned pnpm setup10 and
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile before the production migration gate. The already
locked TypeScript dependency is now available on a fresh runner. No package,
lockfile, runtime, migration, production credentials or Environment policy changes.
Other deploy/certify source gates import only Node built-ins and do not share the
failure. This supersedes the previous checkpoint's next action to use unchanged
5b12 migration tooling.

install completed, module import and offline candidate proof then PASS with the

inherited a different main ref and its ancestry check failed; that fixture ref was
corrected only in the private temporary clone, then the candidate check passed.

# Import confirmation implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Recovery37536969564 was normally
approved and has ATTEMPTED_COMPLETION_UNCONFIRMED at BOOKMARK_AND_IMPORT, without
importFailure or provider code. This supersedes any earlier claim that all incidents
are absent; its exact namespace has not yet been inspected remotely. No subsequent
retry/rollback/0039/application deployment has occurred.

**Changes:** Branch codex/production-import-json-confirmation adds a strict pinned
Wrangler file-import stdout parser and a third sealed SELECT-only inspector for
37536969564/a8fa. Historical incident definitions and compiler bytes are preserved.
The runner saves and repeats the third capture, and requires absent/stable/all-eight
primary guards/no failed reads before any future restore pin/bookmark/import. Query
JSON remains strict. Unknown completion retains sanitized OUTPUT_UNCONFIRMED and
never starts an automatic rollback. Marker observations are not full catalog
certification or provider-terminal evidence; UNKNOWN_NO_CURSOR/retryAuthorized=false
remain explicit. No runtime, migration, payment/auth or Environment policy change.

**Evidence:** Root independently reproduced the third plan receipt exactly against
the retained production artifact:296/36 statements and both SQL hashes PASS.
Implementation checkpoint244a43b includes the final reviewed source. Root final
runner/auth/parser focused3files/194tests PASS36.51s (runner75/auth13/parser106);
inspector163/163 PASS44.27s. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, actionlint1.7.12,
script syntax and diff checks PASS. Both independent reviews report no remaining
blocker after tightening contradictory optional metadata. The first exploratory
full suite was deliberately stopped(exit143) for that final code/test change;
it is not claimed PASS or a regression failure. Full final-source suite PASS:
253files/6160tests,341.60s,Node24.16,maxWorkers2. Hosted final-head/main CI remains pending.
Inspector's first focused attempt had one fixture-only rollback guard failure; it
was corrected by separating drift and real rollback cases, then163/163 PASS.
No live database completion follows from these local tests.

**Next:** Finish parser tightening, full gates and independent final review; publish
and merge a normal PR, require exact-main CI and dispatch one protected inspect-import
with its final reviewed implementation head. Obtain normal vn-taphoanhatung review,
retain sanitized evidence and choose action from the actual third incident. Applied
requires independent complete V1/provenance/runtime proof before0039; absent requires
all stable guards plus separately reviewed intentional recovery; partial/blocked
requires an incident decision. Re-certify the newly merged source through staging
shadow/1/5/25/D1 T20=true, then guarded0039/full production certification and same-source

is not evidence for prior10000. No credential values were read or published.

**Cloudflare console observation:** existing Chrome session is authenticated to
the same account and frigo-db binding. Named `tako-san-production-deploy` account
token is Active, recently used, and the account-policy D1 filter shows Read=1,
Edit=0. This is direct policy evidence for that named deployment token; the
aggregate receipt intentionally contains no token identifier, so name/activity
correlation is not an exact secret-to-token identity proof. No permissions were
changed at this initial observation. User then explicitly confirmed adding only
D1 Edit. Existing token policy was saved once:13 permissions versus12 before,
D1 Read retained and D1 Write added. Reopening the persisted token verifies
Read=1/Edit=1/Active. Existing entire-account resource, no expiry and all-IP policy
are unchanged; no other permission, token rotation, secret value or GitHub secret
was changed. The current receipt's writeAuthorization remains UNKNOWN; console
name/activity correlation is not an exact secret mapping or HTTP write certificate.

under --json/loggerLevelerror. Full stdoutJSON.parse fails; --command query control
is cleanJSON. Runner's file-import parser therefore rejects legitimate successful

# Production asset convergence checkpoint - 2026-10-06 JST

**State:** Release incomplete. Remote main stays
f2b00023ccb9a706d17ebe71321c0364a948ca75 while read-only diagnostics 37450399162
waits for the required production reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. Recovery 37384670328
was normally approved and FAILED with import completion unconfirmed after a
successful static pin. CLI vn-tak cannot approve. No blind retry, rollback or
migration is authorized by this ambiguous result. The operator authorizes release
and confirms no real users; user-data preservation certification is excluded.

**Changes:** Executable a9f1c81582677d4b40806c388d27892edeec1f44 pairs exact
readiness/approved authority with same-origin /sw.js before counting each of three
consecutive observations. Only an otherwise-valid SW with a different canonical
full SHA retries. The existing 90-second shared budget includes request/body time;
no request starts at zero budget. The 256 KiB body limit, HTTP/MIME/no-store/syntax/
strict BUILD_ID/SW marker checks and sanitized errors fail closed. CLI writes a
separate deployedAssets proof; original deployed shape/workflow/smoke are unchanged.

**Checks:** New assets RED 43 fail; final focused 331 PASS, independently rerun by
root. First full suite FAILED: 249 files / 5735 tests PASS, one unrelated catch-up
Wrangler test exceeded unchanged 5000 ms timeout; exit 1 / 512.97 seconds. Isolated
unchanged suite 32 PASS in 3.04 seconds (Wrangler case 919 ms). Cause unproven; no
test/timeout edits. Final full rerun without parallel Wrangler/build: 250 files /
5736 tests PASS, exit 0 / 490.18 seconds. Serial build, lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, syntax and diff PASS. Root reviewed frozen source/tests with no concrete
blocker. A first additional review attempt was unavailable; the later independent
frozen review completed with no blockers,331/331PASS (2.06s), ESLint/diff PASS and
all three file hashes matching the freeze. Shape/BUILD_ID and observed bytes are
proved, not semantic SW execution or complete HTML/JS bundle content.
PR51 head 93e3db2004c518af7694edd4db89e918510c5d72 passed hosted CI37452057402:

and held while diagnostics waits. This new documentation-only checkpoint still
needs final-head hosted CI; exact merged-main CI remains required after merge.
Local isolated recovery SQL probes did not complete (exit143/137); they provide no
import outcome or remote-cause proof. No credentials/remote mutation were used.

**Remote:** Staging 37384738093 FAILED after Worker publication and three exact
readiness observations: /sw.js had not embedded expected f2b. Failed body not
retained, actual prior SHA unknown. Protected authority step did not run; no new
recipeAuthority proof/canary exists. Later public SW/smoke converged. New native
CLI public GET-only rehearsal PASS at 2026-10-06T10:25:27.065Z: three exact pairs /
7907 ms. Separate /tmp manifest preserves the original artifact. This does not
certify protected 500/fingerprint or turn the failed workflow into a success.

**Production:** Recovery proved ledger 38/0038 and 7409664 database bytes, cloned
modules/runtime/bindings/assets, changed only three catalog variables to static/
0/false and confirmed 100% version 1a47f7f7-3d74-4801-b26a-b91f39c7942e.

**Next:** Obtain normal review for read-only 37450399162, inspect stable catalog/
ledger and resolve the unknown import state from evidence. Keep main fixed during
pending operations. Require independently certified V1/static/ledger 38/500/exact

hosted CI, merge after pending operations finish, then exact merged-main CI. Freeze
final SHA and restage shadow/1/5/25/D1 with T20=true. Production same SHA, T20=false:
guarded 0039, read-only certification, shadow, live synthetic AI, then 1/5/25/D1.

# Production replacement candidate checkpoint - 2026-10-06 JST

State: production release incomplete. Current main remains
`cd66bb86ca7c440b606fb8672e89428800df33c2`. PR49 carries AI correction `e7d7db1`
and Worker metadata compatibility correction `1ed5733`. The operator authorizes
production release and confirms no real users; user-data preservation certification
is excluded.

Changes: static-pin now accepts Cloudflare's documented informational metadata
`hasPreview` and `modified_on` alongside legacy `has_preview`. Unknown fields
still fail before mutation. Exact deployed source/runtime/bindings/assets,
module equivalence and approval/freshness fences remain enforced. AI repair
preserves the complete default/custom extraction task/schema; its role in the
observed live INVALID_RESPONSE remains unproven.

Checks: metadata regression red 3 failures / 20 passes; final focused suite
24 PASS, independently rerun. Combined recovery/AI targeted validation five files /
70 PASS. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production build, syntax and diff PASS.
Full combined candidate suite: 249 files / 5653 PASS, exit 0, 514.45s,
unchanged timeouts, one worker, UTC and canonical macOS temp path.

Remote: recovery37334212154 intentionally CANCELLED at 2026-10-05T20:49:15Z,
recover job steps empty, approvals/pending deployments empty. It executed no
Worker/catalog/migration mutation and no longer requires review. Staging canary1
37370418398 FAILURE before steps; annotation: "The job was not acquired by Runner
of type hosted even after multiple attempts". Staging remains healthy shadow
on cd66/T20true; production remains old 136cb6ff/static fallback/ledger38. Actual
catalog recovery,0039 and new production application deployment remain pending.
The earlier normal disposable guest/synthetic scan failed INVALID_RESPONSE;
logout revoked its session. Corrected live provider readiness is still unproven.

External gate: GitHub Actions incident remains active; latest 20:47:22Z update
reports degraded availability. PR49 prior-head CI37371504325 failed before steps at 20:58:30Z with the
same hosted-runner assignment annotation. Final-head hosted CI and exact merged-main
push CI remain required after publication; resolve their current IDs from PR49.

Next: require green hosted CI on the final PR49 head, merge with a merge commit,
require exact-main push CI and freeze the new main. New recovery attempt1 must bind ref to
that main and reviewed_sha to the final merged PR49 head, preserving ancestry
and complete tree equality. Fresh normal production Environment review is needed
only when that new run exists. Require V1_CATALOG_CERTIFIED_STATIC before guarded
0039; full production certification follows 0039. Restage the final SHA through
shadow/1/5/25/D1, paired T20true. Production uses T20false, same immutable SHA,
shadow/live non-PII AI proof before 1/5/25/D1 promotion. Do not reuse the cancelled
run or old reviewed implementation head.

Runner-local final-candidate smoke is prepared at
`/private/tmp/takosan-provider-smoke-final-candidate/live-provider-smoke.py`.
Static syntax and fixture hash PASS; it has not been executed. Require explicit
production SHA and the deployed corrected shadow before its one synthetic scan.

One disposable guest/session/scan was created through normal APIs; logout200
revoked the session. No email/OTP, security bypass or secret extraction.
Provider availability/receipt accuracy remain uncertified. Staging mock does
not prove live provider behavior. Production AI/config and image preprocessing
are unchanged from the deployed Worker in the prior candidate.

Executable AI correction `e7d7db1` preserves the full default/custom extraction
prompt while adding repair feedback on same-model retry and multimodal escalation.
The source bug is independently reproduced: default retry lost task/schema.
It can undermine recovery; its causation of the live failure is unproven.
Regression red4 failed/3 passed; correction and adjacent AI/provider/router
checks5 files/81 PASS. Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff PASS; full local

repair feedback and bounds calls. No AI model/provider/quality/security policy
change. Publish as a separate reviewed fix, hold merge while recovery is pending,
then verify real provider behavior before declaring production release complete.

Next: complete normal review of recovery37334212154, inspect aggregate receipt
and any unsupported provider metadata before further operation. Require V1 catalog
certification, then guarded0039. Merge green AI correction only after the pending
recovery completes or is intentionally replaced; stage the final immutable SHA

# Recovery workflow registration checkpoint - 2026-10-05 UTC

Executable recovery `7f59afa`, registration remediation `aea900d`.
PR46 and47 are merged; current main080b78b has green exact-main push CI37330231950.
Full local recheck and hosted recovery CI each pass248 files /5639 tests.

Actual recovery dispatch is blocked before run creation: GitHub Actions workflow
index/web/GET and CLI/REST dispatch return404 for the new dispatch-only recovery
file, despite its presence on default main and valid actionlint schema. No run,
production approval, Worker change or D1 mutation was performed. The provider
registration cause is unresolved; invalid source syntax is not evidenced.

Minimal remediation adds a main-push registration job containing only echo, with
no checkout, production Environment, secret reference or production tool. The
production gate now explicitly requires workflow_dispatch/main/confirmtrue;
recover still depends on that gate and all authorization checks reject push.
Actionlint1.7.12, lint, diff check and13 approval tests PASS; independent review

# Production V1 catalog recovery checkpoint - 2026-10-05 UTC

Executable checkpoint `7f59afa` on `codex/production-v1-recovery` starts from
merged guard PR #45 / main `603c4404bebd53fce711b47c9d5cef9b30ce2bfa`.
Exact-main guard CI [37320114700](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/actions/runs/37320114700)
succeeded. User confirms no real users; user-data retention certification is
excluded. Source restoration uses certified V1, without assigning ambiguous
positions to the live ingredient population or claiming proven corruption.

Independent implementation reviews found no remaining blockers. The recovery
workflow binds the final merged PR head to the complete exact-main tree and CI,
normal independent production Environment approval and the shared production lock.
It first clones the exact old Worker source/runtime/bindings/assets with only
catalog static/0/cutover=false, then imports one atomic generated catalog batch.
Unknown provider metadata stops before mutation. Lost import response records an
unknown outcome requiring inspection; it never blindly retries or rolls back.
Catalog-only archive rollback requires the unchanged generated target and the
same pinned static Worker. Historical migrations and unrelated tables are intact.

Validation: targeted four suites / 56 tests PASS; lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, production build, syntax and diff checks PASS. Actual local workerd D1
restore and rollback PASS with pinned Wrangler 3.114.17: restore hydrates 500
recipes at fingerprint `f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`,
ledger38/FK0, archive6720; rollback restores6720/order0/FK0. A local compound
SELECT parser limit was reproduced and fixed by using VALUES. Full-suite result
first run: 5638 PASS / one unchanged Wrangler timeout; narrow recheck32 PASS.
Full recheck248 files /5639 PASS (522.82s). Hosted final-head CI
37327411648 also248 /5639 PASS, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build PASS.
PR46 merged at9fbaffa; exact-main push CI is pending before remote execution.

Production still serves the old Worker `136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`
on static fallback, ledger38/0038/order0/hydration0. Remote recovery, migration
and new application deployment counts remain0. Next: merge green recovery PR,
require exact-main CI, run protected recovery and retain aggregate evidence;
then guarded0039, staging and production Deploy with immutable release inputs.

# Production release readiness - 2026-10-05 UTC

Current implementation checkpoint `81255c1` on
`codex/production-release-guards`, from verified GitHub main
`b00eb1356b641602244dae09dcf2c0061b9544a0`. Local main and user files in the
original checkout are preserved; task work uses an isolated worktree.

PR #44 is merged with independent review `5414445860` on
`089ae329ebba2ba38659c030266068aeace9b8a8`. Fresh protected topology run
[37316530751](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/actions/runs/37316530751)
completed successfully after normal production approval by `vn-taphoanhatung`.
The downloaded aggregate artifact digest was verified. Production has 500 recipes,
6,720 lines, zero duplicate occurrences and 4,252 ING_ENR occurrences with zero
current-generator ID matches and no IDs shared with committed V2. V1 targets
remain ambiguous; corruption and writer identity remain unproven.

Implemented fresh live-main/exact-SHA CI gates before upload; rollback now runs
only after upload was attempted. The 0039 migration shares the production lock,
refreshes CI/main and certifies complete V1 hydration/fingerprint and unchanged
ledger before mutation. Historical migrations and application behavior unchanged.
Local full suite 244 files / 5,583 PASS; targeted 5 / 418 PASS; lint/typecheck/

# T21R-C2T-P1 invalid Action pin remediation — 2026-10-05 UTC

**Status:** `T21RC2T_P1_FIXED_READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW`, not production
execution readiness. Fresh branch
`hoplite/mesambria-d133eda3--t21rc2t-pnpm-action-pin` starts from exact live
main `b3fd7baf9c25ae195bdc6f52ed9ca27f34cef455`; implementation checkpoint
`b78283c746b8150ebfc65c0f814f721eccd26a48`.

Run `37304008220` / attempt 1 is
`T21RC2T_CAPTURE_BLOCKED_ACTION_PIN_INVALID`: capture job `111743275723` failed
in **Set up job** resolving a nonexistent pnpm action commit. Gate passed and
historical normal Environment approval was completed, but Cloudflare/capture/
topology never started, D1 SQL 0, no receipt, no artifacts. This is not a
production diagnostic or corruption finding; the run was not rerun.

Independently dereferenced annotated `pnpm/action-setup` tag `v4.3.0` and verified
its commit `b906affcce14559ad1aafd4ab0e942779e9f58b1`. Only that workflow pin changed;
other three action commits exist upstream and are unchanged. The safety test
now checks the exact expected refs, not merely SHA shape, and rejects the prior
invalid pin offline. Node/pnpm/install and all C2/C2T runtime semantics unchanged.

Checks: baseline 5/5 exposed the blind spot; intentional pre-fix red 1 failed /
5 passed; post-fix narrow 3 files / 62 PASS, established 14 / 539 PASS
(C2T 6/119; C2 8/420), full 243 / 5,548 PASS. Lint/typecheck/local migration
smoke/build/diff checks PASS. Real-Git comparison confirms only one workflow pin
changed and all 73 C2 review-bound specifications unchanged. No post-fix failures.

**Publication/Next:** [PR #44](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/pull/44) is
confirmed draft/open/unmerged, no auto-merge; update subscription enabled.
Hosted CI in progress; no human reviews or unresolved threads at publication.
STOP and obtain fresh independent review by `vn-taphoanhatung` on the final head.
Old review `5412451575`
does not authorize these changed review-bound bytes; no merge or readiness
conversion. All P1 production operation counts 0; corruption NOT PROVEN; repair
needs more evidence; 0039 relevance NONE; 0039/deploy NOT AUTHORIZED; T21G NOT READY.

# T21R-C2T privacy-safe identity topology implementation — 2026-10-05 UTC

Implementation checkpoint `f191b48`, branch
`feat/t21rc2t-identity-topology-diagnostic`, from exact certified PR #42 main
`5218b0b`. Live main and checkout matched the packet before editing; fresh main
still matched before publication. Repository `vn-tak/Tako-san`, ID `1385308553`.
Exact-main authority CI `37261145409` / job `111608452594`, attempt 1, push,
SUCCESS was verified via GitHub metadata, including all five required steps.

Status `T21RC2T_IMPLEMENTED_READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW` means implemented,
locally tested and published as draft PR
[#43](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/pull/43), **not execution authority**.
The final docs-inclusive SHA and its fresh hosted CI receipt are maintained in
the PR rather than self-referenced here. Auto-fix subscription is enabled; no
auto-merge. Required independent human review is NOT YET PERFORMED.

**Implemented:** Separate C2T approval/capture/workflow, offline source authority
and topology, closed deterministic aggregate-only receipt, whole-partition K5
suppression and post-recheck private recomputation. All 119 unique review-bound
path specifications are covered (78 required files, 6 full directory roots,
35 optional paths), including all 73 C2 paths. Existing C2 and application,
authentication, payment, inventory, Week, catalog, config and migration bytes
remain unchanged. Exact C2 SELECTs/envelope reused; new production SQL 0.

**Actual offline evidence:** V1 500/2,702; committed V2 500/6,766; generator lineage
4,233/4,233 ING_ENR occurrences and 1,395/1,395 distinct IDs, zero mismatches.
The required 500/2,702/6,720/6,766 synthetic fixture, candidate competition,
multiplicity, 65-row residual with 6/59 drift split, two-sided shape accounting,
privacy/error/hash prohibitions, suppression, schema and determinism pass.
No production topology result is claimed.

**Executed checks:** Cloudflare credentials removed; Wrangler telemetry disabled.
`TZ=UTC pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t21rc2t-*.test.mjs
tests/unit/t21rc2-*.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rc-row-reconciliation.test.mjs
--maxWorkers=1` — 14 files / 538 tests PASS (C2T 6/118; unchanged C2 8/420).
`TZ=UTC pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` on checkpoint `f191b48` —
243 files / 5,547 tests PASS, exit 0, 626.96 seconds, Node 24.21.0.
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (local in-memory SQLite),
`pnpm build`, syntax and staged/baseline `git diff --check` PASS.

**Failures/recovery:** Initial V2 loader omitted the hashed nutrition-evidence
member; corrected to all 503 members and rerun successfully. Corrected a
multiset fixture's remaining-only count and an internally inconsistent final-
authorization fixture. Internal implementation audit found equal concept aliases
mislabeled as context-only and missing exact-witness competition accounting;
both were fixed with regressions, preserving explicit context/mixed-key coverage.
Approval compatibility preserves C2's distinction between policy availability and
actual self/bypass use. No assertion, timeout or existing coverage was weakened.

**Frozen boundary:** C2F remains `T21RC2F_ADDITIONAL_DIAGNOSTIC_REQUIRED`;
corruption NOT PROVEN; repair REPAIR_NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE; 0039 relevance NONE,
application NOT AUTHORIZED; deploy NOT AUTHORIZED; T21G NOT READY.
Production dispatch/D1/Cloudflare calls, Environment approvals, C2/C4I reruns,
repair, remote migration, canary and deployment operations: 0.

**Next:** After confirming the PR's final immutable head and current-head CI,
hand off separate T21R-C2T-R security/privacy/authority review to
`vn-taphoanhatung`. Keep PR draft and unmerged; do not approve, mark ready,
dispatch, query production, repair, apply 0039 or deploy.

# T21R-C2F semantic drift and ingredient identity forensic — 2026-10-05 UTC

Read-only forensic of production run 37202777157, attempt 1. Execution SHA
`075be110a868a9a9c4d6c24f20342c5ccb7017c4`, reviewed `ae19f0571d7e9236e8cf014f65b22d2d3d381df3`. Verified: artifact 11304380358
digest, run head and all five source digests (receipt integrity PASS). No
production read, C2/C4I rerun, repair, 0039, deploy, or secret/Environment change.

Status `T21RC2F_ADDITIONAL_DIAGNOSTIC_REQUIRED`.

**Proven from code and aggregate:**

- The two identity totals are structural partitions:
  - V1_ID 2,468 = 26 exact + 1,793 same-ID drift + 649 production-only known IDs;
  - UNREVIEWED_ING_ENR 4,252 = 4,232 AMBIGUOUS + 20 ID conflicts.
  They hold because there are zero bridges, the registry is exactly the 45 V1 IDs,
  and V1 contains no ING_ENR.
- The 65 non-deterministic V1_ID rows are same-ID multi-row drift:
  6 membership_plus_content + 59 name_plus_semantics.
- All 2,702 targets are AMBIGUOUS because unresolved ING_ENR rows are candidates of
  every target in their recipe; ≥896 targets have no other candidate.
- The pre-C2S classifier would reject this snapshot at schema. C2S changed exactly
  26 target classifications.

**What production holds:** one replacement population.

- Not V1: 26/6,720 exact, zero V1 physical IDs.
- Not a subset of committed V2: 4,252 > 4,233 ING_ENR rows.
- No repository pipeline writes ING_ENR rows, so the writer is outside the
  repository (UNKNOWN).
- ING_ENR IDs are unreviewed provisional enrichment identities; zero bridges is the
  expected state.

**Runtime:** D1 content cannot pass hydration or the V1 fingerprint gate, so every
surface uses static content. Recipe 404 for imported IDs is possible in D1 modes.

**Decisions:** 0039 relevance NONE. Repair REPAIR_NEEDS_MORE_EVIDENCE: duplicates and
semantic equivalence need the proposed hashed C2T diagnostic.

**Checks:** focused Vitest 6 files / 178 PASS; recipe import/refresh/ingredient-v2
checks PASS; release-check BLOCKED as expected. Documentation only; hosted PR CI is
the confirming gate. DEPLOY NOT AUTHORIZED; T21G_NOT_READY.

# T21R-C2S schema boundary — 2026-10-04 UTC

Offline implementation checkpoint `946a7be` on
`codex/t21rc2s-schema-forensic`, from fetched certified main
`b9bc66acfe660329103c08be1f5cff90ed175aba`. Draft PR
[#41](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/pull/41) is open; its final
docs-inclusive SHA and exact-head CI receipt are maintained there, not
self-referenced in this checkpoint. Independent review remains required.

Latest source evidence is the task packet's run 37158525748, attempt 1:
capture/cleanup PASS, `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC`, engine completed,
`T21RC2_CLASSIFICATION_SCHEMA_REJECTED`, artifacts 0. No raw production evidence
was retrieved. Production/V1 relation stays UNKNOWN; repair need UNDETERMINED.
The older generic run 37135187427 does not supersede this schema-stage evidence.

Confirmed offline defect `T21RC2S_ROOT_CAUSE_CLASSIFIER_SHAPE_BUG`:
`T21RC2S_TARGET_UNIQUE_CANDIDATE_CARDINALITY`. Original certified-main modules
emit a `UNIQUE` target with two candidates for one exact witness plus an unresolved
or cross-ID competitor: schema FAIL while aggregate/digest PASS. The unchanged
schema is correct. Targets now retain ambiguity/full candidate evidence for
competition; an uncontested unique target contains only its satisfying witness,
preserving the existing exact-tuple/same-ID-drift contract. The precise historical
production condition remains unverified.

Schema failures now expose only reconstructed `section/field/keyword/code` from
actual-validator-only private categories, fixed allowlists and known schema rules.
Ajv 6.15.0 retains `allErrors:false` / `jsonPointers:true`; unknowns fail closed.
Caller metadata, accessor races, raw paths/indices/values/messages/params/data,
causes and subprocess output do not enter diagnostics. No failure artifact upload.

Final local focused command with all eight C2 suite paths: 8 files / 420 PASS.
`TZ=UTC pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1`: 237 files / 5429 PASS, exit 0,
676.74 seconds, Node 24.21.0. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS.
The initial full command hit the 600-second shell limit (exit 124, incomplete,
not a test pass); the unchanged command completed under an 1800-second budget.
Interim TS declarations, overbroad A3 ambiguity and CLI loader escaping failures
were corrected without suppressions, assertion weakening or timeout-threshold edits.

All 73 C2 bound entries remain; old reviewed head
`95b1746819c4690d267985ce55cb0ba673373a95` rejects the new execution bytes.
Capture/11-read SELECT authority, workflow, closed schema, V1, C4I, packages,
migrations and application runtime are unchanged. Auto-fix subscription is enabled;
any branch advance invalidates review of an earlier exact head. No auto-merge.
The separately observed baselineComparison aggregate gap is documented, not
repaired or confused with the schema defect.

Production C2/C4I runs, production SQL, mutations, secret/token changes,
migrations and deploys are 0. Local migration smoke uses in-memory SQLite only.
Token scope UNKNOWN/read-only proof false; repair NOT_AUTHORIZED;
0039/deploy STOPPED; T21G_NOT_READY.

Next: confirm the PR's fresh attempt-1 final-head CI, independently review that
exact immutable SHA, and do not merge, rerun C2/C4I or repair production.

# T21R-C2D classification diagnostics — 2026-10-03 UTC

Branch `codex/t21rc2d-classification-diagnostics` from certified main `78313ab`.
Implementation checkpoints `fbce4a1`, `3054b4a`, `4be7e18`; final head and fresh
hosted PR CI receipt are recorded in the draft PR, not self-referenced here.

Source run 37135187427 attempt 1: gate/capture/cleanup PASS, classify FAIL with
`T21RC2_CLASSIFICATION_REJECTED`, artifact SKIPPED. Metadata was read without
raw logs or evidence. Snapshot CAPTURED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC; production relation
to V1 UNKNOWN_BECAUSE_CLASSIFIER_DID_NOT_COMPLETE. Identity/database/ledger/
roster/fixed-SELECT/stability/write guards remain proven by capture success.

Classification now distinguishes capture_binding, authority, reconciliation,
schema, aggregate and digest with fixed `T21RC2_CLASSIFICATION_<STAGE>_REJECTED`
codes. Tiny diagnostic receipts reconstruct only code/stage; no Ajv paths/data
or raw context. No workflow/failure upload/capture/SQL/credential change.

Offline repro fixes: an uncaptured parent now remains malformed/unattributed,
not an extra recipe summary; aggregate validation checks recipe-local candidates,
derived recipe status and drift/conflict indexes. All nine enum families match
the unchanged closed schema. Offline authority remains 500/2702 and the certified
release/fingerprint. Divergence, extreme drift, malformed rows and duplicate
physical IDs all produce valid manifests. These bugs do not prove the historical
production rejection's cause; its stage remains unresolved.

Final focused C2 suites: 6 files / 375 PASS. Final `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS;
`TZ=UTC pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1`: 235 files / 5384 PASS, exit 0.
Hosted CI is pending at this documentation checkpoint; its exact-head receipt
belongs in the draft PR. C2 old `a0d4bf9` binding rejects the implementation;
73 bound entries unchanged. C4I execution/binding unchanged.

Next: fresh exact-head attempt-1 PR CI, then independent review of all C2 stages
and contract fixes. Do not merge or rerun C2/C4I. Production SQL/mutations and
secret/token changes 0; repair NOT_AUTHORIZED; 0039/deploy STOPPED; T21G_NOT_READY.

# T21R-C4L Wrangler parsed-stdout remediation - 2026-10-03 UTC

**State:** `T21RC4L_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW` pending fresh hosted PR CI.
Branch `codex/t21rc4l-wrangler-parsed-output-fix` from certified main `0e6342f`;
exact head recorded in the PR/publication receipt; implementation commit `262a61366e4a`.

Finding `T21RC4_WRANGLER_LOG_SUPPRESSION_BUG_CONFIRMED`: under the lockfile's
Wrangler 3.114.17 (spec `^3.114.0`, unchanged), `WRANGLER_LOG=error` suppresses
`logger.log`/`logger.table`, emptying the whoami account table, `d1 list --json`
and `d1 execute --json` stdout that C4I/C2 parse. Fix: C4I child env and C2
`parsedWranglerStdoutEnvironment` (renamed from `captureExecutionEnvironment`,
used by identity and fixed SELECTs) set `WRANGLER_LOG='log'`; stdio stays piped,
debug-log sink/path, commands, SQL allowlist and all validation are unchanged.

C4I runs 37124563415 and 37128183771 and C2 run 37084988593 cannot prove an
account mismatch; their identity conclusions are
`INVALIDATED_BY_WRANGLER_LOG_SUPPRESSION_BUG` (run/gate/approval facts, whoami
command success, zero C4I SQL and zero mutation remain valid). The
operator-reported `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` update before 37128183771 occurred, but
correctness is `UNVERIFIED_PENDING_FIXED_C4I`.

Old reviewed SHAs are intentionally void: C4I `a0c1cfd` → remediation head
rejects `T21RC4I_REVIEW_BINDING_REJECTED`; C2 `93c4055` rejects
`T21RC2_REVIEW_BINDING_REJECTED` (both still accept `0e6342f`; closures not
weakened). A new exact head needs independent review covering both C4I and C2
execution surfaces.

Local: focused C4I 4 files / 103 PASS, C2 4 files / 256 PASS; regressions fail
(10) with scripts reverted to `error`. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, `git diff
--check` PASS; `TZ=UTC pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` 234 files / 5,322
PASS (Node 24.21.0).

No production C4I/C2 run, Environment approval, D1 SQL, secret/token mutation,
migration, 0039 or deploy. `SAFE_TO_RUN_C4I=NO`, `SAFE_TO_RUN_C2=NO`;
T21G_NOT_READY. Next: independent security review of the exact head (both
surfaces); do not merge or dispatch. Details: `recipe-catalog/T21RC4L_WRANGLER_PARSED_STDOUT_REMEDIATION.md`.

# T21R-C4I independent-review remediation - 2026-10-03 JST

**State:** Remediation of independent review findings on draft PR #38 is locally
validated and awaiting fresh hosted CI and independent delta review. Repository
`vn-tak/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`), branch
`codex/t21rc4-cloudflare-identity-diagnostic`, reviewed pre-remediation head
`a5966c7fa27b67d16ff02acb753cd2bc82c372fa`; certified main remains
`7cd58968c3b4c0f7936c75d74b6965d229b57c69`. Final remediation SHA is
recorded in the publication receipt rather than self-referenced here.

**Changes:** Separate C4I closure binds the diagnostic workflow, CI workflow,
three C4I scripts, package/lock/config and optional package configuration bytes.
A credential-free gate requires reviewed ancestor, exact current main and
successful exact-main push CI. The production job verifies gate outputs, then
validates the specific independent Environment approval and current main before
the Cloudflare-only step. Account ID syntax now matches C2 for 32 case-insensitive
hex characters. Command and malformed-response statuses no longer claim auth or
scope without evidence. C2's 73 review-bound paths remain unchanged.

**Local validation:** Eight focused C4I/C2 files, 340/340 PASS (C4I 93, C2 247).
Full UTC single-worker Vitest run: 234 files, 5,303/5,303 PASS. ESLint,
typecheck, migration smoke, web/Worker build and diff check PASS. Initial full
runs exposed missing files in a partial checkout and a macOS `/var` temp-path
alias; after completing the checkout and using `TMPDIR=/private/var/tmp`, the
same unchanged C2 suites and full run passed. No C2 source/test was edited.

**Boundary and next:** Production diagnostic NOT_RUN; C2 rerun NO; production
Environment approval NO; production D1 SQL reads/writes 0/0; production,
secret and token mutations 0; 0039/deploy STOPPED. Historical run 37084988593
remains `T21RC2_IDENTITY_REJECTED`; token scope UNKNOWN, read-only scope
unproven. Push this additive remediation to draft PR #38, require fresh PR CI
on the new exact head, then stop for independent review. Do not merge or run
the diagnostic. Details: `recipe-catalog/T21RC4I_CLOUDFLARE_IDENTITY_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.

# T21R-C4I identity metadata diagnostic — 2026-10-03 JST

**State:** `T21RC4I_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`, not live identity
certification. Repository `vn-tak/Tako-san` / `1385308553`; isolated branch
`codex/t21rc4-cloudflare-identity-diagnostic` starts exactly at certified
`7cd58968c3b4c0f7936c75d74b6965d229b57c69`. C3 is PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_CERTIFIED;
independently reviewed C2 authority remains `93c4055a42cd2d94f4db296d8ca10d555c2c52c2`.
Published implementation checkpoint `81646b0e6389fe61ea04db5892dec8ee597693f9` has

`00c68d1b21f9dd965a1936632ee479b1320d16f2`; API commit metadata alone differs.
Original local history is preserved. Completion docs follow; their own final
local/remote SHA is recorded externally, not embedded in this document.

**Implemented:** Separate manual/main/attempt-1 production diagnostic, minimal
contents-read permission, certified Action pins and shared non-cancelling lock.
Fixed whoami/list commands only; A–H safe failure categories, allowlisted JSON,
captured stdout/stderr, discarded Wrangler debug logs, no artifact or SQL.
Isolated strict JSONC verifier matches the existing verifier in eight fixtures.
No C2 execution byte or 73-path closure member changed. Real-Git additive
regression passes; a bound-byte mutation still rejects. Future C2 eligibility
remains conditional on exact future-main binding/ancestry/CI and normal approval.

**Verified:** Focused 6 files / 308 PASS (C4I 61, unchanged C2 247).
Lint/typecheck/local SQLite migration smoke/web-Worker build/syntax/diff PASS.
Final UTC single-worker full run: 232 files / 5,271 PASS, zero skips, exit 0,
494.41 seconds, external Node transport blocked. Initial inherited-PDT full run
was 5,269 PASS / 2 FAIL; unchanged Week/expired-OTP suites then passed 32/32
with test-process TZ=UTC. No Week/auth code or assertion changed. Earlier pnpm11
worktree and workflow-test syntax setup failures are recorded in the report.

**Failed live attempt / limits:** Run 37084988593 attempt 1 failed identity
before SQL: D1 SQL reads/writes 0/0 and production mutations 0; whoami and/or
D1-list metadata may have executed, exact progress not distinguishable.
The historical cause is not diagnosed retrospectively. C4I live diagnostic
NOT_RUN, C2 rerun NO, Cloudflare calls by this implementation 0; secrets/tokens/
Environment unchanged. Token scope UNKNOWN, read-only permission unproven.

**Next / boundary:** Independent review of final C4I head before any PR,
protected integration or separately authorized metadata-only run. No PR/merge,
dispatch/approval/production SQL/mutation/secret edit/0039/deploy. T21G_NOT_READY,

# T21R-C3 production dispatch readiness — 2026-10-03 JST

**State:** `T21RC3_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`;
code, local verification and approved documentation publication complete.
Current owner login/write access is working.
Repository `1385308553` now resolves to `vn-tak/Tako-san`. Isolated branch
`codex/t21rc3-production-dispatch-readiness` starts at certified PR #36 merge
`0d4fe89b7ccc72e013aafe53665059d0e62bd3b4`; its exact-main push CI
`37008867187` is SUCCESS and `63739c56` had independent approval. Historical
C2 is `PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_CERTIFIED`; C3 does not authorize live capture.
Code checkpoints: `57edc3ac9c2b3f86d28774c0c26bb1e9a961746e` and final tested
fixture checkpoint `a34ec5e3245b5fdc6718c611ae23dcea6f56eb4c`.
GitData publication code checkpoint `e49c60a176cec80593e8b8644d058341cfeca720`
has the exact same tested executable tree `5b20d72eeb4f0077ac17b0d0e8584e4596292fb3`
and certified main parent; only its commit metadata/identity differs.

**Implemented:** Four verified upstream Action commits pin all six production
`uses:` entries. Workflow semantics and CI full history are unchanged. Gate and
receipt authorize the new repository name with unchanged ID; the V1 target's
recorded review-time name/bytes remain historical. All 73 bound entries are
retained; any future dispatch needs the independently reviewed final C3 head
plus matching post-merge current main and CI. A credential-free packet/runbook
documents exact inputs, pins, privacy, aborts and unresolved permission scope.

**Verified:** Focused 8 files / 556 tests PASS (C2 247, C/B/release 309).
Additional guarded AI/local-D1 6 files / 128 PASS. Full single-worker final run:
230 files / 5,210 PASS, zero skips, exit 0. Lint, typecheck, local SQLite migration
smoke, web/Worker build, syntax and diff checks PASS. The test-only AI recovery
fixture now returns synthetic 401 instead of making a real call-through request;
assertions/timeouts unchanged. Local proxy/installer failures and automatic
egress-review rejection were resolved and recorded in the scoped report. The
final run blocks external Node transport; one transport attempt was denied before
network use. No unrestricted full-run success is claimed.
The exact published code checkpoint was also rechecked: C2 4 files / 247 PASS,
11.39 seconds. Its first command could not find the old scratch pnpm entrypoint;
the existing local Vitest entrypoint then passed without dependency changes.

**Governance / limits:** Read-only GitHub metadata confirms production and
User reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` / `329713999`; self-review prevention false,
admin bypass available true, branch policy null. Availability is not use;
existing validator rejects self/skipped/bypass approval. Metadata audit PASS;
future actual approval NOT_RUN. `QUERY_PATH_SELECT_ONLY=true`,
`TOKEN_SCOPE_READ_ONLY_PROVEN=false`, scope UNKNOWN; no Cloudflare metadata call
or token/policy mutation. No application/T19/T20/config/migration changes.

**Publication access:** Earlier normal push had no CLI credential (exit 128); the
`takovn2` connection's first workflow-blob write returned HTTP 403, `Resource
not accessible by integration`. That failed path created no C3 ref/commit/PR. Neither
earlier implementation connection's installation listing included owner
`vn-tak`; the exact missing permission was unproven. The current session now
verifies `vn-tak` / `335007142`, installation `167341024`, and actual blob writes.
Use this connection for normal GitData feature publication; preserve original
local history, verify tree equality, fetch and verify final local/remote SHA.
No login, permission change or reviewer-account write is needed. The previous
recovery ZIP is a historical checkpoint, superseded for current status.

**Publication:** Automatic approval review previously rejected the full historical
CURRENT_STATE payload, one evidence-based retry, and the narrower C3 report for
public operational metadata without explicit payload/destination consent.
On 2026-10-03 JST the user explicitly confirmed publication of all five documents
from the private approval packet to public `vn-tak/Tako-san`, including completion
status updates. The documentation checkpoint follows the published code SHA
above through a normal feature-ref update, preserving its tested executable
bytes and original local history. No force push or new login is needed. Final
documentation-inclusive local/remote SHA and tree equality are reported in the
external completion receipt; this document cannot contain its own commit hash.

**Boundary / next:** Independently review the final published C3 head before any PR.

# T21R-C2 PR #36 CI-history remediation — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** Local CI-history correction on the same C2 branch; renewed exact-head
independent review required. Repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`,
PR #36 OPEN/unmerged; pre-remediation head `3e1bb60b7afa9706fca6bfed41252bfd4d421cdd`,
base main `518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`. One narrow normal-push
checkpoint after that head; no rebase/force push/merge.

**Diagnosis / change:** Failed hosted run `37002486858` / job `110823126447`
used checkout depth 1 and synthetic PR merge `db7728d0203089e8f35897f2fff2f2e35437e026`.
Historical reviewed/main Git object was unavailable to capture-suite setup,
surfacing the safe `T21RC2_LEDGER_CHANGED`. Full local history proves the 39-file
repository contract and exact first 38 live-ledger names unchanged. Offline
depth-1 clone reproduces the missing-object failure. CI checkout now uses
`fetch-depth: 0`; one static workflow regression requires it. No ledger/count/
tip/name guard, capture/classifier/production workflow/configuration, version,
timeout/assertion or 73-entry review-bound list change.

**Executed:** C2 4 files / 229 tests PASS (capture 70, approval 143, receipt 8,
workflow 8); requested focused regressions 8 files / 538 PASS. Lint/typecheck/
local SQLite migration smoke/build PASS. Full single-worker result and exact
commands are recorded in the scoped report: 230 files / 5,192 PASS, 701.72 seconds.
Hosted-success evidence is not
available at this pre-publication checkpoint; check the automatically triggered
new PR run on the exact new head, not an old-head rerun.

**Boundary / next:** CI workflow bytes are review-bound, so the old head's
independent approval is not current for this delta. After local gates pass,
normal push, verify new-head hosted ESLint/typecheck/Vitest/migration smoke/build;
stop if that run fails. Final per-head evidence lives with PR checks and ignored
`.hoplite/artifacts/t21rc2-pr36-ci/`. Obtain independent delta review and renewed
PR approval before merge. No production dispatch/approval/Cloudflare/read/write/

# T21R-C2 review-binding remediation only — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC2_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`; not independently re-approved
or production-ready. Repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`, same branch
`codex/t21rc2-protected-production-row-read`, reviewed parent
`8d8028f3e3358655b19fa2dd02ba883e57c52204`, prior implementation `ad7b3012`;
base main `518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`. One logical remediation
checkpoint follows the reviewed parent; no rebase, squash or force push.

**Changed:** P1 adds immutable 73-entry execution-closure byte equality to the
existing ancestry gate, rejects `reviewed_sha=ref`, and repeats binding through
capture reauthorization and final recheck. Actual local Vite/import/source tracing
documents the added dependency paths; configs absent at review remain bound
against later introduction. P2 adds success fields `queryPathSelectOnly=true` /
`tokenScopeReadOnlyProven=false`; failure receipts do not claim completed query
attestation. Workflow, classifier/schema/target, capture, T19/T20 and privacy unchanged.

**Executed:** Requested focused `--maxWorkers=1` command PASS, 8 files / 537
tests: C2 228 (approval 143, capture 70, receipt 8, workflow 7), T21R-C 57,
T21R-B 16 and release-check 236. Full `pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1`
PASS, 230 files / 5,191 tests, 608.00 seconds. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, modified script syntax and diff checks PASS.
All A–L and gate/pre-credential/final binding regressions use real temporary Git
objects plus mocked API responses. Initial helper-import/scope test errors fixed;
no assertion/timeout weakened. Scoped agent review passed 151 approval/receipt
tests with no material finding; not human approval of the full closure/delta.

**Boundary / next:** Production dispatch/read/Cloudflare call/mutation/approval/
SQL write/restore/migration/0039 apply/deploy: 0; local SQLite fixtures only.
No secrets used, PR, merge, delivery/storage/configuration or dependency change.
Normal push of this one tested delta is authorized; verify exact local/provider
HEAD and seek independent delta review from `8d8028f3` before opening any PR.
`ROW_LEVEL_DELIVERY=UNCONFIGURED`, `T21G_NOT_READY`; repair NOT_AUTHORIZED,

# T21R-C2 executable protected row-read — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC2_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`. Correct branch
`codex/t21rc2-protected-production-row-read` starts exactly at certified main
`518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78` in repository `1385308553` /
`vn-tako4/Tako-san`; base exact-main push CI `36972970904` SUCCESS. Wrong-direction
local `9542e112` remains only on the old branch and is not C2 ancestry.
Verified executable checkpoint `ad7b3012` (`ad7b3012fc13c53948cdf7cbac4362df2662dee5`)
was normally pushed; GitHub branch HEAD equaled local implementation HEAD.
No PR/merge. This handoff follows that implementation checkpoint.

**Implemented:** Dedicated manual workflow; full-SHA/current-main/reviewed-ancestor/
exact-push-CI guards; API-shaped independent normal approval, skipped/bypass/self
rejection and fresh remote-main rechecks; pinned account/database/config; four
fixed SELECTs; exact 0038 ledger, independent counts/certified rosters and two-read
non-atomic digest stability. Reuse merged classifier/schema credential-free;
restrictive runner-temp raw/full evidence, private Wrangler logs, redacted failure
codes and aggregate-only success artifact. Row delivery `UNCONFIGURED`.

**Executed:** Focused C2 + T21R-C/B + release-check command (`--maxWorkers=1`)
PASS, 8 files / 455 tests: new C2 146 (approval 62, capture/privacy 70, receipt 7,
workflow 7), predecessor 73, release-check 236. Full
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS, 230 files / 5,109 tests, 525.17 seconds.
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, all C2 script
syntax and working/staged diff checks PASS. Initial fixture/integration failures
and the unchanged 5-second synthetic setup timeout are recorded in the report;
source fixture moved to `beforeAll`, no timeout/assertion weakened. Independent
agent review found no material defect; not human/Environment authorization.

**Boundary / next:** No production read/Cloudflare call/dispatch/approval/mutation/
SQL write/restore/migration/0039 apply/deploy. SQLite smoke is local throwaway
fixtures. T19/T20/runtime/legacy classifier/schema/workflows/migrations/dependencies
unchanged except the new dedicated C2 workflow. No hosted C2-head CI or live
receipt exists; no delivery/storage/settings provisioned. Independent review of
the published executable implementation before any production authorization.
`T21G_NOT_READY`; repair NOT_AUTHORIZED; 0039/deploy STOPPED.

# T21R-C P1 remediation only — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`; local verification complete
on `codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation`, reviewed parent `32ab51d35976e5174f73a544729f8bd7fd20e02c`,
repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`.
Exact tuple balance is an explicit satisfaction guard; direct V1 IDs cannot be
rewritten by reconciliation. A1/A2 already failed closed before this delta;
B1/B3's production-only/missing misclassification was reproduced and corrected.

**Checks:** 57/57 T21R-C and 73/73 focused regressions PASS; lint, typecheck,
local migration smoke, build, syntax, formatting and diff PASS. Full
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1`: PASS, 226 files / 4,963 tests,
678.21 seconds. Existing two-worker timeout
and dependency advisories are not being changed or re-audited.

**Boundary / next:** Only classifier/tests and necessary handoff/design docs;
taxonomy/schema/authorities/runtime/workflows/migrations/dependencies unchanged.
Production reads/writes/dispatches/approvals/restores/applies/deploys/repair: 0.
One remediation checkpoint after the reviewed parent; normal push authorized
for independent delta review. No independent approval, PR, merge or production
dispatch preparation. `T21G_NOT_READY`; 0039/deploy/repair STOPPED.

# T21R-C protected row-level evidence — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC_OFFLINE_DESIGN_READY`. Offline classifier, closed evidence schema and protected-read design
implemented on `codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation`, based on verified main
`a828b6354e29d89268a3d11c874158eb5ecb997c` in repository `1385308553` (`vn-tako4/Tako-san`).
V1 release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4` remains the certified target; V2 is not release
authority. Verified implementation checkpoint: `ec24101`
(`ec24101bd906b820d3a6ac29dcc179dd62a1d3fa`); this handoff is a later documentation checkpoint.

**Evidence:** Historical protected run `36943692146/1` succeeded: 500 recipes,
6,720 occurrences, 26 exact, 1,793 same-ID drift, 20 ID conflicts, 6,694/2,676
unmatched production/target, ledger 0038, zero order rows and 0/500 hydrated.
Four sanitized artifacts and their exact GitHub digest metadata were verified.
Approval history records `skipped` by `vn-tako4`; data remains acceptable for
review with an admin-bypass governance exception, not normal reviewer approval.

**Executed:** Focused Vitest 3 files / 67 tests (51 T21R-C + 16 existing)
PASS; both real-source offline CLI smokes PASS on synthetic 500/2,702 data,
zero approved bridges; Ajv schema/output checks, syntax, formatting, lint,
typecheck, local in-memory migration smoke, build and diff check PASS.
Full two-worker Vitest completed 226 files / 4,957 tests with one existing
5-second certification-pipeline timeout (4,956 passed); final unchanged
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS: 226 files / 4,957 tests,
837.08 seconds. No timeout/assertion weakened. Dependency
audit separately reports 33 existing advisories: 4 low, 17 moderate, 12 high,
0 critical; no dependency/lockfile change.

**Boundary / next:** No live T21R-C rows classified or new production read,
mutation, SQL write, restore, migration/0039 apply, deploy, flag change, push,
merge or PR. The required SQLite fixture tests are local only. `T21G_NOT_READY`;
repair, 0039 and production deploy remain stopped. Normal required-reviewer
approval is mandatory for any future mutation; bypass is forbidden. Independent
human classifier/schema/query/privacy/stability review and separately approved
restricted artifact delivery are needed before any separately authorized read.

# Production V2 existing_canonical_id review fail-closed — 2026-09-30

PR #30 P1: `existing_canonical_id` now rejects any non-null `review` (including `{}`). Valid existing bridges still require distinct non-empty `sourceId` and `review=null`. Local gates: typecheck, ESLint, migration-smoke=ok, focused V2 tests 27/27, Vitest 222 files / 4,851 tests, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS. Combined `pnpm check` NOT_RUN.

# Production V2 catalog lineage diagnostic remediation — 2026-09-30

Hardened PR #30 matcher: missing-line reasons are candidate metadata (`missingLinesCausallyExplained=false`); cross-ID content matches are informational unless reviewed/existing reconciliation; relative canonical order is separated from runtime position (`runtimePositionAuthority=false`). No extra D1 query, no mutation, no production diagnostic dispatch. Local gates: typecheck, ESLint, migration-smoke=ok, Vitest 222 files / 4,841 tests, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS. Combined `pnpm check` not re-run (prior 600s cap). Hostile tests cover ID conflict, provisional reconciliation, classified-but-not-causal missing lines, and position holes. Next: hosted CI on the new head and independent review. Keep 0039/restore/repair STOPPED.

# Production V2 catalog lineage diagnostic tooling — 2026-09-30

Verified `origin/main=252096cccf602d07d6e33067024c5df2d6ba8a3e` with exact-main CI `36640577701` SUCCESS and protected production diagnostic `36653466481` SUCCESS (Environment-approved, identity PASS, no mutations). Receipt: ledger 38/0038, 500 recipes all `version=2`, 6720 ingredient rows, 0 order rows, 0/500 hydrated; V1 lineage `CATALOG_LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED` with 0 exact historical lines. This branch adds a runner-local semantic comparison against canonical Recipe Refresh V2 (500/6766, hash-verified, `productionReleaseReady=false`) using already-read catalog rows. No extra production query, no Cloudflare secret on the new step, no application runtime change. `researchV2LineageProven=false`. Local gates: typecheck, ESLint, migration-smoke=ok, Vitest 222 files / 4,839 tests, `pnpm build` PASS. Combined `pnpm check` was killed at 600s while tests were still running; the same gates were executed separately. Focused V2 lineage 15/15 and diagnostics workflow tests included in the full suite. Next: review/merge, exact-main CI, then Environment-approved read-only rerun to inspect `production-catalog-v2-lineage-<run>-<attempt>` before any recovery design. Keep 0039/restore/repair STOPPED. See `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_CATALOG_V2_LINEAGE_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.

# Production catalog lineage diagnostic tooling — 2026-09-30

Local migration replay through immutable 0038 has 500 recipes and 2,702 ingredient lines with 2,702 explicit positions, versus the last protected production receipt `36577380500` (6,720 lines / zero positions / zero hydrated). PR #27 merged as main `e7c74a0`; its order-recovery STOP packet is preserved below. PR #28 is the separate read-only lineage diagnostic; it reuses the production diagnostic's existing exact-main, CI, Environment and identity gates and its already-read raw catalog data, uploading only sanitized V1 line/position comparison counts and digests. It neither proves V2 lineage nor grants position/release authority. See `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_CATALOG_LINEAGE_DIAGNOSTIC.md`. No production run of the new tooling, mutation, migration, deploy or T20 enablement has occurred. Next: review/merge PR #28 only after new CI and review, require new exact-main CI and production Environment approval, then inspect its read-only receipt before proposing any repair.

Prior PR #28 head `fe1d2e5` passed hosted CI `36630071407` (221 files / 4,823 tests), plus local `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check`. During synchronization with #27, a new spawned-CLI test exposed a missing `writeFileSync` import that would have prevented the workflow from saving a receipt. The import is fixed; focused tests pass 15/15 and the updated local `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` passes typecheck, lint, full Vitest, migration smoke and build. Hosted CI for the updated head remains pending. Earlier default-concurrency runs failed the unrelated staging Wrangler startup test's five-second timeout; a separate long-running attempt under machine interruption also failed and is not counted as green.

# Production ingredient-order diagnosis — 2026-09-29

PR #26 merged to main `d0c670289534c33187181b2eb7192c05a2962e22` and exact-main CI `36576510231` passed. Production Environment-approved read-only run `36577380500` passed its workflow gates; its sanitized receipt is `BLOCKED`, not release certification. D1 `frigo-db` / `f975ec39-b2c8-4a2a-80e1-0366054599d3` remains at ledger 38/0038. It has 500 physical recipes, 6,720 ingredient lines, zero ingredient-order rows, and 500 `missing_ingredient_position` hydration failures (0/500 hydrated). Cause/timing and live-content identity remain unproven. The recovery STOP packet is `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_INGREDIENT_ORDER_RECOVERY_PACKET.md`. Documentation-only follow-up `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` passed locally (typecheck, lint, Vitest, migration smoke, build). No production mutation, migration, restore, deploy or T20 enablement occurred. Next: reviewed read-only per-line identity/position provenance; do not apply 0039 or rebuild positions from counts.

---

# Production D1 order-coverage validation — 2026-09-29

The count-only follow-up passed `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check`: typecheck, ESLint, 220 test files / 4,816 tests, migration smoke and build. Focused SQLite query and diagnostic tests passed 7/7; `git diff --check` passed. The first unfiltered `pnpm check` failed one unrelated local Wrangler staging catch-up test by its 5-second timeout; focused rerun with metrics disabled passed, followed by the complete green run. Follow-up PR review, hosted CI, exact-main CI and protected production Environment approval remain pending. No production mutation or deployment occurred.

---

# Production D1 order-coverage follow-up — 2026-09-29

PR #25 merged to protected main as `baf9a069f89f9544407c827448671ecea4c56b5a`; exact-main CI run `36571635467` passed. GitHub PR API reports zero reviews, so the merge does not establish independent review. Production Environment-approved read-only diagnostic run `36572487026` passed its gate and identity checks. Its sanitized receipt reports the production D1 ledger at 38 through 0038, missing only 0039; 500 physical recipes, zero hydrated, with all 500 failures coded `missing_ingredient_position`. This receipt is diagnostic only. The 2026-09-25 production certification run `36150184637` previously reported 500 hydrated and zero failures. Public production readiness still reports `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS` fallback. No production mutation occurred.

A local follow-up branch from the merge SHA adds a second count-only SELECT to the protected diagnostic, reporting recipe ingredient rows, order rows, missing join rows, affected recipe count and orphan order rows. It validates the aggregate against the runtime read before saving a sanitized artifact. Focused tests: `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/production-d1-diagnostics.test.mjs tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs tests/unit/d1-readonly-query.test.mjs` — 3 files / 71 tests PASS. Hosted CI, independent review and a new Environment-approved run remain pending. The 0039 migration cannot repair ingredient order; `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`, production rollout remains blocked.

---

# Production D1 identity gate verification — 2026-09-29

The PR #25 account-identity repair passed final local `pnpm check`: lint, typecheck, 220 files / 4,814 tests, migration smoke and build. `git diff --check` passed. Hosted CI is pending on this new head; there is still no independent GitHub review. No merge, production read, D1 mutation or deployment occurred in this continuation. Next: push the reviewed gate repair, wait for exact PR-head CI and independent review; only then protected merge, exact-main CI and production Environment-gated read-only diagnosis.

---

# Production D1 diagnostic continuation — 2026-09-29

PR #25 had green CI at `d2e481e75e652262310ac0db5cc3bf324397c08e` (run `36567679646`) but no GitHub review, so no merge. Fresh public readiness: production Worker `136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`, configured D1/0/cutover true, global static, `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS`, degraded; staging Worker/main `8072e0fea9f8f3588426969007dda06cadbbfbb7`, D1/0/cutover true, global D1, no fallback, OK. This does not prove private production hydration codes.

Review found the new diagnostic's `whoami` result was discarded before matching the configured Cloudflare account. The workflow now validates credential presence/account ID shape and checks the `whoami` output contains that account before any D1 query, matching the existing production certification gate. Focused tests after the repair: 6/6 PASS. Full local and hosted final-head checks are pending. No production mutation, merge, or deploy occurred. Next: finish checks, obtain independent GitHub review, protected merge and exact-main CI before a production Environment-gated read-only diagnostic. Migration 0039 and the D1 fallback remain independent release blockers.

---

# Production D1 diagnostic PR checkpoint — 2026-09-29

PR #25 (`codex/production-d1-diagnostics`) is open for independent review. Implementation commit `ad30b7efeac7a4db71665a318fb4869396e4ce98` passed hosted PR CI run `36566901147` (lint, typecheck, Vitest, migration smoke, build). Final local `pnpm check` on that commit passed 220 files / 4,813 tests and all other gates. This documentation checkpoint does not change executable code; hosted CI on its final PR head remains required before merge. No production mutation or rollout occurred. Next: obtain independent review, protected merge, exact-main CI, then run the separate read-only diagnostic under production Environment approval. The production 0039 ledger gap and `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS` fallback remain release blockers.

---

# Unified production train D1 investigation — 2026-09-29

Status: `BLOCKED_PRE_PRODUCTION`. Main remains `8072e0fea9f8f3588426969007dda06cadbbfbb7`; exact-main CI run `36491414297` SUCCESS. Read-only production certification run `36563767379` passed the exact-main gate, production Environment approval, active Worker version/deployment and D1 binding identity, then failed because the production ledger lacks `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`. Active Worker is `136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`; public readiness is D1/0/cutover true but global static with `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS`. Missing migration and recipe hydration fallback are independent blockers. No production migration, deployment, flag change or rollback was performed.

Branch `codex/production-d1-diagnostics` adds a manual, production Environment gated, exact-main read-only diagnostic workflow. Its artifact contains only ledger names/counts and recipe hydration code counts, never recipe rows or IDs. It also corrects the production migration workflow's post-apply runtime catalog proof to execute five guarded SELECTs via `d1-readonly-query.mjs` rather than Wrangler's `--file` import API. The reviewed 0038 to 0039 plan, recovery and STOP gates are in `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_0039_MIGRATION_PACKET.md`.

Local verification: `pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS after expanding the sparse checkout; focused five-file Vitest run 305/305 PASS; `pnpm check:migrations` PASS; `pnpm build` PASS; final `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage pnpm test` 220 files / 4,812 tests PASS; `git diff --check` PASS. Initial typecheck failed because sparse checkout lacked `src/web` and `src/shared`; initial full test run had 17 failures from missing `data/recipe-refresh`/`artifacts` fixtures plus one overloaded Wrangler timeout. Those paths were added; focused rerun 48/48 and final full rerun passed. These are local checks, not hosted or production certification.

Next: obtain independent review and hosted PR CI, merge only through protected main, then rerun exact-main CI. After that, dispatch the read-only diagnostic through production Environment approval, identify hydration failure codes, and resolve the fallback separately. The migration packet remains unexecuted pending its listed preconditions and an exact production ledger/plan proof. `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA` remains unset.

- PR #22 exact reviewed head `439451afeb81aee732c3e7d13acaf0a194b1e70e` merged normally as main `94056d29ed00a1000e65eb8e1348384638bc02af`. Exact-main CI `36476834182` / `109112533990` passed lint, typecheck, 216 files / 4,804 tests, migration smoke and build.
- Official staging deploy `36477693577` succeeded on that SHA; production job skipped. Worker readiness confirmed DB/Queue ok, AI mock, recipe canary 1%, T20 true. Guest quota API reached five ready scans and returned `SCAN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` on sixth; replay/conflict/tenant checks passed. Direct D1 ledger and staging failure injection were not observed: `STAGING_QUOTA_API_PARTIAL`.
- Follow-up branch `codex/scan-synthetic-ocr-certification` adds deterministic 4-case/16-variant synthetic receipts, local Apple Vision measurement, conservative alias corrections, and trusted CORS exposure of `X-Request-Id`. Local focused 28/28 and `pnpm check` passed. These changes are not yet part of the deployed main SHA.
- `SYNTHETIC_OCR_LOCAL_BASELINE_COMPLETE`: Apple Vision read all 16 variants with 100% normalized names, quantity/unit, line prices and totals, 0 name character errors, 194-512 ms per run. This is not a Qwen result. `REAL_QWEN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_CONFIGURATION` because staging AI is mocked and no dedicated non-production Qwen configuration is available.
- `ORIGINAL_QA_DATASET_UNAVAILABLE` and `LIVE_OCR_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_DATASET_UNAVAILABLE` remain independent gates. Original receipt images and independently transcribed ground truth are missing. Details and exact operator paths are in `docs/ai/scan/SCAN_OCR_REMEDIATION_CERTIFICATION.md` and `qa/ocr/README.md`. Production status: `NOT_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION`; no production deploy.

# Historical snapshot — Scan/OCR/AI quota remediation (2026-09-28)

**Status: `SCAN_REMEDIATION_CODE_CERTIFIED_LOCAL`; live gate `LIVE_OCR_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_DATASET_UNAVAILABLE`.** PR #22 is open on `fix/scan-ai-quota-ocr-reliability`. Review found that an async queue-intent write failure left a failed scan and released quota but replaying the same key could reserve again. The fix keeps that command terminal even without a queue job, returns `SCAN_FAILED`/503, and requires a new key for a new attempt. Sync replay behavior remains covered by its existing tests.

The final unfiltered local `pnpm check` passed: 216 files / 4,804 tests, typecheck, ESLint, migration smoke, and build. The first run had one unrelated 5-second AI provider test timeout (4,803/4,804); its focused rerun and the second full run passed. Implementation head `45b6115f5b8bbf54f44182ae8bd9e28d49fa3e8a` passed hosted CI run `36437178487` (ESLint, typecheck, 216 test files, migration smoke, build). Verify the final PR head has a green check before any release decision. Staging read-only health and readiness returned 200 at `12348efd015ae72337fbeb08651150a7d28ee638`, with DB/queue ok and AI `mock`. The staging release workflow accepts reviewed main releases, so PR #22 was not deployed; staging does not certify the PR or live OCR.

The private four-receipt dataset is absent. `qa/ocr/README.md` identifies runnable repository fixture tests and the exact operator paths/schema. The benchmark correctly returns `DATASET_UNAVAILABLE`. No QA data was invented; no merge or production deploy occurred. Production recommendation: `NOT_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION`.

# Current state — T19 cooking hard-restriction hotfix (2026-09-28)

**Status: `T19_COOKING_HARD_RESTRICTION_HOTFIX_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.** Branch
`fix/t19-cooking-hard-restriction-bypass` from exact main `85660fa497f3da7110a07ec2189309fbef81d701`.
`POST /api/v1/recipes/:id/cook/start` and `/cook/complete` previously skipped
household hard restrictions entirely; the fix enforces the canonical T03
`evaluateHardRestrictions` (fail-closed) at both boundaries via new
`src/worker/services/cooking-hard-restrictions.ts`, reusing
`candidateRestrictionFacts` + the canonical nutrition evidence provider over a
minimal candidate shim. Contract matches T20: 422 `HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`.
Idempotent successful replay preserved (restriction check runs after the replay
lookup on both legacy and adopted-lot paths). No D1 catalog change, no
migration, no secret/config change, no deploy. Staging stays canary 1%.

Proven locally: regression `tests/integration/t19-cooking-hard-restrictions.test.ts`
15/15 PASS (bug reproduced 9-fail before fix); nearby suites
`t19-recipe-authority-split` + `recipe-authority-routing` 19/19,
`t20-legacy-family-and-safety` + `t20-meal-composition-flows` 31/31;
`tsc -p tsconfig.worker.json` clean; eslint clean on touched files.
Next: push branch, open PR, await review/merge. Do NOT promote canary.

# Current state — T19-R0 staging D1 runtime readiness certifier (2026-09-27)

Implementation `61bf805ca77ceeb92df501fa1965d24856d45bff` on `feat/t19-staging-d1-runtime-readiness-certifier` from exact main
`e35df74b7a10ee6de1677bf8e059c7ef82ad55fc`. This task added a staging-only, read-only certification
workflow and checker. It does **not** claim `STAGING_D1_RUNTIME_READINESS_CERTIFIED`
because the workflow has not been dispatched.

Proven locally: focused 31/31 PASS; `pnpm check` PASS (typecheck, lint, Vitest,
migration-smoke, build). No D1 mutation, staging/production deploy, recipe-authority
mode change, T20 flag change, or 0040. Next: independent review/merge; after
exact-main CI the operator may dispatch **Staging D1 Runtime Readiness**.

# Current state — T20 live staging hard time blocker and repair branch (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_LIVE_HARD_RESTRICTION_BLOCKED_P1`.** Canonical main
and live staging Worker are
`9d64178b8bbc8f07672a1e9f0434867f3699f339`. Deploy run
`36306554840` / artifact `10927776649` succeeded with planner and T20
Worker/UI flags true, static recipe authority, 71 served recipes, healthy
D1 readiness, and production skipped. PR #17 merged; exact-main CI run
`36306274814` succeeded. No later staging or production deploy occurred.

LIVE User A `usr_1790496416217_u02mk` /
`hh_usr_1790496416217_u02mk` owns isolated plan
`6aa36637-7a3f-4d4e-a531-c19d233fe6f8`; User B
`usr_1790496420287_ajiz4` /
`hh_usr_1790496420287_ajiz4` has no plan from the failed hard-time
attempts. API flag/picker PASS (71 static recipes); browser E2E composition
visible with role labels and no fatal page error. Manual add/lock/unlock/
reorder/swap/save/remove and repeated reload PASS. Stale write returned
409 `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`; B's read/add/swap/save/apply all returned 404
and A's state stayed intact. Assisted generated/applied 11 candidates;
Auto generated/applied 15 candidates and a four-component meal; scores
were finite and reload matched. Shopping reflected initial components,
valid swap, removed component, duplicate ingredients and simple-food rice.

LIVE hard-time plan creation for B with slot `hardMaxTimeMinutes=10` and
`20` returned HTTP 500 `MEAL_PLANNING_UNAVAILABLE` before any plan
persisted. This P1 blocks hard restriction certification and therefore
full T20 live certification. Worker tail logs and read-only post-smoke D1
PRAGMA access are unavailable locally; do not mark those gates PASS.
A local direct-service reproduction identified the strict T05 projection
failure on an unplanned slot carrying `hardMaxTimeMinutes`. Source inspection
also identified a T20 slot-time policy gap; no unsafe LIVE T20 component
was proven persisted.

Branch `codex/t20-staging-hard-time` from exact main contains the proposed
repair (ADR-038); PR #18 is open on head
`9f040f6921a8a6871c1233627edf5ddda3fda552`. Focused T20 HTTP 4/4,
lint, typecheck, migration smoke, staging-style build and canonical-clone
full `pnpm check` PASS. Hosted exact-head CI, review, merge and redeploy
remain pending. Do not certify the current staging release. Production,
T19 recipe authority and 0040 remain untouched.

# Current state — T20 live staging planner prerequisite PR #17 (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_PLANNER_PR17_REVIEW_PENDING`.** Canonical main is
`b44e9355ce8988e7acb7c3b12c55bc2b27340e1a`. Staging Deploy run
`36305024017` succeeded on that exact SHA with T20 Worker/UI flags true,
recipe authority static/0/cutover false, production skipped, and runtime
served recipes 71. Live health reports the same SHA, staging, health ok and
database ok. The 500 physical staging D1 recipes remain outside static
runtime authority.

Two registered staging test accounts now exist: User A
`usr_1790496416217_u02mk` / household
`hh_usr_1790496416217_u02mk`; User B
`usr_1790496420287_ajiz4` / household
`hh_usr_1790496420287_ajiz4`. Credentials and sessions are stored only
in a local mode-0600 temporary file; no secrets appear in this record.
The unauthenticated picker returned 401, but the authenticated T20 picker
returned 404 `MEAL_PLANNER_DISABLED`. Source confirms the parent
`MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED` Worker gate and `VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED` UI gate
were absent from staging. No test meal plan has been created yet.
The operator explicitly authorized enabling both planner prerequisites
on staging while retaining T20=true and static recipe authority.

PR #17 (`codex/t20-staging-planner-enabled`, implementation head
`7c8b6d8b548872b95c2695862e7bd1a962ad7701`) sets only staging
Worker/UI planner flags and adds a release guard that rejects a T20 staging
build if either planner prerequisite is off. Production configuration and
recipe authority are unchanged. Local focused tests 20/20, lint, typecheck,
staging-style build and migration smoke passed; local full check passed
4,726/4,727 tests, with the known local Wrangler D1 catch-up timeout.
Hosted PR CI run `36305647997` is in progress and must pass on the final
head. After review/merge, require exact-main CI, then manual staging-only
Deploy with T20=true/static/0/production=false. Reverify live SHA and run
the full original LIVE matrix. Do not infer certification from source or CI.

# Current state — T20 staging account fix PR #16 (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_PR16_REVIEW_PENDING`.** Canonical main remains
`dff7446855964d9fc60008c370ef656371652a13`; live staging Worker also
serves this SHA with T20 enabled, static recipe authority and healthy D1.
PR #16 (`codex/t20-staging-turnstile`) contains Turnstile test-key pairing,
registration/OTP coverage, and a manual-only Deploy trigger so a main merge
cannot automatically redeploy staging with T20=false. ADR-035/036 record both
decisions. Implementation head `ef5ebd8a5c3d52475c0951b83a0bb6a6ca2eef06`
passed hosted pull-request CI run `36299373601`: lint, typecheck, Vitest
208 files / 4,725 tests, migration smoke and build. The final documentation
checkpoint requires its own exact-head CI check after push.

Local gates on this patch: Turnstile focused 2/106 PASS; release workflow 2/254
PASS; lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build PASS. Local full Vitest had
4,724/4,725 PASS with one unrelated existing staging D1 catch-up test timing
out in the local Wrangler CLI, even with a longer timeout. Hosted CI passed
that test. `git diff --check` PASS.

No registered User A/B exists. No staging deploy, Worker var change, D1
mutation, recipe-authority change, production action, T19 rollout or 0040 was
performed. Next: independent PR review and merge; exact-main CI; explicit
staging-only Deploy on the merge SHA with both T20 flags true, static recipe
authority and zero canary. Then verify the new Worker SHA, register User A/B,
and run the original LIVE T20 certification. Do not infer live success from CI.

# Current state — T20 staging account fix, release gate pending (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_FIX_BRANCH_READY_DEPLOY_BLOCKED_RELEASE_GATE`.** Canonical
`takovn1/Tako-san` main is `dff7446855964d9fc60008c370ef656371652a13`.
Implementation commit `027c628` on `codex/t20-staging-turnstile` changes only
Turnstile verification and tests. This documentation checkpoint records the
release constraints. The deployed staging Worker remains at `dff7446` and still
has both T20 flags enabled, static recipe authority, and healthy D1.

Live registration with the official Turnstile test widget token returned HTTP
403 `TURNSTILE_FAILED` twice. Guest creation worked, but T20 requires a
registered account; no User A/B or T20 test plan was created. The live Worker
secret and its outbound Siteverify response were unavailable. A mismatched
retained secret is the leading diagnosis, not a proven live cause; direct
Siteverify with Cloudflare's published test token/secret pair succeeded.

ADR-035 pairs the exact staging test site key with the matching public test
secret while still requiring a token and explicit Siteverify success. Other
staging keys fail closed without a secret; production verification is unchanged.
Local focused Vitest 2 files / 106 tests PASS. On an exact-main canonical clone,
`pnpm check` PASS: lint, typecheck, 208 files / 4,724 tests, migration smoke,
build. `git diff --check` PASS. The inherited managed-worktree `origin/main`
points to an old repository and caused at least one of two initial full-suite
Git-history failures; the identical code passed the canonical clone.

The standard Deploy workflow only accepts a reviewed exact-head SHA on main
with hosted CI. A push to main triggers automatic staging deploy with T20
input defaulting to `false`, which would turn off the currently enabled feature.
Do not push directly to main or dispatch a release that weakens this gate. A
separate reviewed release path that preserves T20=true is needed before live
account creation and certification can continue. No staging deploy, Worker var,
recipe-authority, D1, or production mutation was performed in this fix.

Next: review branch and resolve the main/automatic-deploy flag coupling with
the release operator. Then deploy staging with T20 server and UI flags true,
prove the new Worker SHA, register User A/B, and run the original LIVE matrix.
Production/T19/0040 remain out of scope.

# Current state — T20-R1 staging release observability convergence (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_RELEASE_OBSERVABILITY_FIX_IN_REVIEW`.** Branch
`feat/t20-staging-release-observability` from exact main
`0b2e0a17578bdc744427944b90db5b76bdbfe33c` (unmoved). No deploy, no
`workflow_dispatch`, no D1/R2/Cloudflare mutation, T20 flags still `false`.

Root cause (confirmed from source and the run `36285175574` receipt, which has no
`previousRecipeAuthority`): staging never captured the serving Worker's
protected recipe-authority evidence before deploying, so when the edge briefly
answered from the previous Worker (`8147dde8…`) after readiness 3/3 + smoke on
`0b2e0a17…`, the wait helper could not classify it and failed closed.

Change (ADR-034): staging step `release-check.mjs previous-authority` (before
`command: deploy`) records `previousRecipeAuthority` +
`previousRecipeAuthorityProof`; `waitForRecipeAuthorityEvidence` retries only
the exact proven previous Worker, passes only exact target commit + state, and
fails every other body immediately. Strict evidence fetch (HTTP 200 JSON only).
Production preflight unchanged; production same-SHA retry now needs the exact
captured evidence.

Next: independent PR review and merge. Then a flag-OFF staging Deploy re-prove
(`meal_composition_v2_enabled=false`) must end fully SUCCESS, including the
protected recipe-authority proof, before any separate T20=true staging rollout.

artifact `10919819859`, ledger `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`, recipes 500).
Do **not** dispatch Deploy to enable T20.

Exact-main CI `36284857635` SUCCESS. Local: `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm lint`
PASS, `pnpm check:migrations` PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`), focused T20 11 files /
120 tests PASS, full Vitest 208 files / 4,654 tests PASS, `pnpm build` PASS.
No application code changed.

Blocking P1 (not a T20 domain defect): Deploy run `36285175574` (push of this
same SHA) deployed the Worker (wait-for-release + `post-deploy-smoke.sh` PASS)
then failed `scripts/release-check.mjs authority`: protected
`/api/v1/health/recipe-authority` `commit` was `8147dde8…` not `0b2e0a17…`.
A T20 flag-on staging Deploy uses that same step after `wrangler deploy`, so
flags could turn on while the job is red. Do not weaken the check. No
production/T20 enablement/0039 re-apply.

Next: fix or independently re-prove the recipe-authority commit identity on
staging for `0b2e0a17…`, then operator-dispatch Deploy (`environment=staging`,
`meal_composition_v2_enabled=true`, recipe catalog left `static`/`0`).

# Current state — Runtime Ingredient Model V2 review candidate

**2026-09-27: staging 0039 certification blocked before remote identity; offline
runtime-model work continues from certified main.** PR #11 merged as exact
`main` `8687ff9f3e8f6b6cbf466ee61968bb5f3469498c`; hosted CI run
`36269257668` succeeded with 204 files / 4,597 tests, lint, typecheck,
migration smoke and build. The reviewed staging-only workflow run
`36269963768` / job `108481914553` passed exact-main/config/CI checks but
failed on the first Cloudflare D1-list read with authentication error 10000.
Ledger, bookmark, remote DB identity, FK/quick and schema gates were never
reached; the migration apply step was SKIPPED. No remote database, media or R2
inspection was performed afterward. Production state remains unknown, not
certified by prior reports. Sanitized receipt:
`artifacts/runtime-ingredient-v2/staging-0039-attempt.json`.

Branch `codex/runtime-ingredient-model-v2` starts at that exact main;
implementation checkpoint `1c9a585cd39cfd9e3b2b8b8256dbd41ed9878110`.
ADR-033
and `RUNTIME_INGREDIENT_MODEL_V2.md` describe an offline V2 ingredient contract,
consumer map and explicit evidence queues. The canonical 500-file source is
unchanged; SHA remains
`da87da20475fa8d7ec92c716e899ee572339573258ae6d9cc7f3f8f554f2d695`.
The deterministic audit reconstructs 6,766 source rows, 3,770 current V1
projected rows, 2,996 exclusions and 2,860 excluded rows needing review. A
hostile pass additionally flags 169 already-projected culinary/package/other
unit rows for independent conversion review. This is an offline triage finding,
not a changed canonical fingerprint or runtime cutover. The 1,395 distinct
`ING_ENR_*` IDs present in recipe rows remain provisional; no promotion was
recorded. The V1 schema, static 71, current D1 reader, recipe authority and
T20 logic are unchanged. `recipe:refresh:release-check` remains intentionally
red with the original four blockers. No 0040, final release manifest, staging
apply, production mutation, deployment or T20 enablement occurred.

Local focused V2/refresh tests (3 files / 35 tests), source/import/audit checks,
typecheck, lint and final `pnpm check` passed: 206 files / 4,615 tests,
migration smoke and build. Hosted PR #12 CI run `36271741260` / validate job

Next: repair only the staging Environment Cloudflare D1 credential,
re-dispatch the same reviewed workflow against current certified main, then
capture production/media read-only evidence with verified identity. Independently
review the conversion/ingredient/source/nutrition queues before any final
release projection. Do not merge PR #12 as a staging or production readiness

# Current state — Ingredient icon pack v2 (2026-09-27)

**Latest (2026-09-27):** branch `feat/ingredient-icons-v2` rebased on `origin/main`
`c6ea259` (PR #12 merge). Replaces the `getIngredientImage` if-chain with a
data-driven rule table (`src/web/lib/ingredient-icon-rules.json`, 214 rules)
plus 39 new transparent PNGs under `public/frigo/ingredients/`
(15 vegetables, 16 pantry, 8 generic category icons). `frigo-assets.ts` gains
the 39 keys and a new `ingredients.generic` section. All 8 existing call
sites keep the 2-arg signature (new optional 3rd `category` param).

**Status: `ICON_V2_PR_OPEN`.** PR #13
(`feat/ingredient-icons-v2` → `main`) opened 2026-09-27, rebased on
`origin/main` `c6ea259` (PR #12 merge), pushed via Git Data API
(tree byte-identical to local). Hosted CI is the final full-suite gate;
monitoring runs. No merge, no deploy from this task.

Post-rebase local gates (2026-09-27): `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm lint`
PASS, focused icon test 7/7 PASS, `vitest run tests/unit` 119 files /
2,478 tests PASS (incl. 18 new PR #12 tests), `pnpm check:migrations`
PASS, `pnpm build` PASS.

Behavior vs the old if-chain (audited on the real 500-dish / 6,766-row data):
- Old: 43.3% of displays fell back to the tomato icon (salt, pepper, sugar…);
  18/48 existing PNGs were never referenced; mis-matches (cá lóc→salmon,
  dầu mè→cooking-oil, trái bơ→butter).
- New: specific icon or truthful category icon for ~99.8%; category fallback
  (spice/meat/seafood/vegetable/fruit/grain/dairy/other) instead of tomato;
  tomato survives only as a last resort when an asset key is missing.
- Specific-before-generic ordering fixes cá hồi→salmon vs cá→white-fish,
  dầu mè→sesame-oil vs dầu→cooking-oil, trái bơ→avocado vs bơ→butter.
- Unaccented phase (word-boundary regex) recovers "Dau an", "Muoi", "Nuoc loc"
  (no `oc`-in-`nuoc` collision), "Duong cat trang" (no `cat`→meat collision).
- 11 ambiguous normalized forms (bo, ca, dau, me, chao, cat…) never guess:
  phase 2 drops them, and phase 1 now also skips bare ambiguous keywords
  (`me`, `chao`) when the input itself has no diacritics — fixes the old
  `"Me"` → tamarind-fruit mis-resolution. Unaccented "Me"/"chao" now land on
  category-other; accented "mè"/"cháo"/"chao môn" still resolve precisely.
- Pre-PR semantic audit of grouped keywords: ngao→seafood, hương thảo→spice,
  kỷ tử/ô liu→fruit, kinh giới/rong biển→vegetable, pate/pancetta→meat,
  đá viên→water, mứt→fruit — each lands on its truthful category icon
  (no wrong *specific* icon assigned); kept as designed.

Tests: `tests/unit/ingredient-images.test.ts` covers exact-ID matching,
specific-over-generic ordering, unaccented recovery, ambiguous no-guess,
category fallback, 2-arg backward compatibility, and existence of every
referenced asset in `frigo-assets.ts` and on disk (incl. all 39 new PNGs).

Boundaries: no PayOS/payment/billing/checkout/webhook, auth or infra change;
no migration; no deploy; production D1/R2 untouched. Not merged — PR only
after local `pnpm check` completes.

Next: finish `pnpm check`, commit, open PR from `feat/ingredient-icons-v2`,
require hosted exact-head CI green and reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` before any
merge. Do not enable anything or deploy from this task.

# Historical current state — Recipe Content Refresh V2 research canonicalization

**PR #11 remediation (2026-09-27): `RECIPE_REFRESH_V2_RESEARCH_CANONICALIZED`; production release blocked.**
Implementation checkpoint: `1f77902` on
`codex/recipe-content-refresh-v2-canonical` (PR #11). The final local
`pnpm check` passed with lint, typecheck, Vitest, migration smoke and build.
PR #11 is open and mergeable; hosted CI run `36268138066` passed on exact
documentation head `dea13cddb0c153d325baa593700545d801c9e851` with
204 files / 4,597 tests, migration smoke and build. The PR description now
records the release blockers and remote boundary.
This section supersedes the earlier source-ready wording below. The original
ZIP still yields 500 recipes, 4,938 steps and 6,766 ingredient lines. The
source manifest now records `canonicalSourceReady=true`,
`runtimeProjectionReady=false`, `productionReleaseReady=false`, four typed
blockers, and `finalRuntimeFingerprint=null`. The 3,770-row projection and
its `6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`
fingerprint are provisional. Of 2,996 excluded rows, 2,860 require reviewed
transformation. Generated ingredient concepts are provisional: 505 existing,
0 reviewed new, 1,642 provisional new, 368 alias reconciliation rows. Source
URLs are declared/structurally valid; content verification has no URL-specific
record in the package. Nutrition remains 1 publishable, 288 blocked and 211
truthful null. The source build/check and separate expected-failing release
gate are in `scripts/recipe-refresh-v2.mjs`; the new root hash and exact
verification checkpoint are recorded in `HANDOFF.md`. The
remediated source artifact SHA-256 is
`da87da20475fa8d7ec92c716e899ee572339573258ae6d9cc7f3f8f554f2d695`
(previously `fc7eefe6573ee9de1083728db1f34b058954fa60ff478f7c5e41dce9e4570dbe`). Next:
runtime/content reconciliation, reviewed ingredient authority, final release
projection/fingerprint, then generated 0040. No remote mutation, deploy, 0040,
or T20 enablement occurred.

## Historical pre-remediation receipt (superseded)

**Previously reported (2026-09-27): `RECIPE_REFRESH_V2_CANONICAL_SOURCE_READY`.** The
canonical repository is `tako-vn/Tako-san`; work started from exact
`origin/main` `c81d6da2b3a9c051270b97953bfbb2c5aa34d057` on branch
`codex/recipe-content-refresh-v2-canonical`. Implementation checkpoint
`fc5e713e10e0b63c890ba31fc29d9678be896ed7` is pushed. This certifies the
source/compiler package only: no migration 0040, D1/R2 mutation, deploy,
recipe-authority change, or T20 enablement occurred.

## Recipe Content Refresh V2 canonical package — 2026-09-27 UTC

The input ZIP SHA-256 is
`ebc18f06ee7fb4498f8cd2a7886f333a85b385f32af4407ae1b44b4ec3cc06fe`.
Independent audit found 500 recipes / 500 unique IDs, exactly the current
500-ID release set; 4,938 steps; 6,766 ingredient lines (not the reported
6,720); 15 root schema variants; 1,102 source references / 1,072 unique URLs;
and 289 numeric plus 211 null source nutrition profiles. The normalized
package has one strict schema, 6,743 quantified and 23 qualitative rows, 166
process-only plus 7 mixed-process rows, and 3,770 runtime-projected versus
2,996 intentionally excluded ingredient rows.

Canonical source is in `data/recipe-refresh/v2`; machine audit artifacts are
in `artifacts/recipe-refresh-v2`; the human receipt is `AUDIT_REPORT.md`.
Canonical artifact SHA-256 is
`fc7eefe6573ee9de1083728db1f34b058954fa60ff478f7c5e41dce9e4570dbe`;
the runtime fingerprint from the repository's real `fingerprintRecipes()` is
`6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`.
`pnpm recipe:refresh:check` validates the 500-ID set, strict schema, units,
ingredient IDs, quantities, step numbering, nutrition agreement, reviewed
exceptions, per-file hashes, root hash, and runtime fingerprint.

Nutrition was re-audited rather than copied: 353 calculation candidates, 1
publishable profile, 288 blocked profiles, and 211 truthful null profiles.
Blocked/null recipes expose no certified runtime macros. In particular,
`vn-hap-01` no longer publishes sodium from a 500 g salt bed and
`imp-6eaf6ed6d417c52c` no longer publishes energy from 1 L of frying oil.
Ingredient reconciliation contains 2,515 rows: 505 existing IDs, 1,642 new
reviewed `ING_ENR_*` mappings, 368 duplicate aliases, 0 ambiguous and 0
invalid. The static 71-recipe `ALL_RECIPES`, INSERT-only import compiler,
release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, migrations through 0039, media readiness, and
current authority behavior remain unchanged.

Local release gates on the final documentation tree: focused refresh tests
11/11, `pnpm recipe:refresh:check`, `pnpm recipe:import:check`, `pnpm
typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `git diff --check`, and `pnpm check` PASS; full
Vitest is 204 files / 4,591 tests. A first full run exposed that this managed
worktree's sparse-checkout omitted tracked `public/` assets; adding the
tracked directory to the sparse set restored the checkout, and its 24 CSP/PWA
brand tests plus the complete gate passed without repository changes.

Next: independent PR review and hosted exact-head CI. After merge, build the
Content Refresh V2 manifest and generated `0040_recipe_content_refresh_v2.sql`
from this pinned package, then certify staging before any production rollout.

# Historical current state — T20 release gate

**Latest (2026-09-26):** PR #9 merged into `main` at `cb22cfb` and exact-main
CI passed. Cloudflare login now works locally, and read-only D1 list/info
match the staging ID in `wrangler.staging.jsonc`; the operator packet's
Section 0 ID still disagrees. A staging-only migration workflow is in PR #10
for review; no staging schema mutation or T20 flag enablement was performed.
The next section is current; later entries are historical.

## T20 staging migration tooling preflight — 2026-09-26 UTC

Cloudflare staging login follow-up: `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device
--browser=false --scopes account:read user:read d1:write` completed after owner
approval; this disposable CLI did not change repository dependencies. The
repository's Wrangler 3.114.17 `CI=true pnpm exec wrangler whoami` now reports
authenticated (its earlier zero exit had printed "You are not authenticated").
Read-only `CI=true pnpm exec wrangler d1 list --json` finds exactly one
`frigo-db-staging-v3`, with the ID from `wrangler.staging.jsonc`;
`CI=true pnpm exec wrangler d1 info frigo-db-staging-v3 --config
wrangler.staging.jsonc --json` independently matches both name and ID. The
operator packet's Phase B ID matches these; its Section 0 ID does not. Treat
the live list/info and reviewed config as identity evidence, not as permission
to use the conflicting packet ID. No ledger, schema, bookmark or row query was
run; no staging or production D1 mutation/deploy was performed. Next: PR #10
review and exact-head CI, then verify GitHub staging Environment identity and
run its read-only gates on merged exact-main before any 0039 apply. Do not
infer CI credential access from this local OAuth session.

`git fetch --all --prune` confirmed `origin/main` `cb22cfb` (merged PR #9).
Hosted exact-main CI `36240577660` / validate `108400172569` SUCCESS (202
files / 4,574 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build). Automatic deploy
`36240842196`: release/staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED; staging remains
static-authority, T20 OFF by default, **not** T20 staging certified.
`git diff --check` and `pnpm check:migrations` PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`).
Wrangler 3.114.17 is installed but `CI=true pnpm exec wrangler whoami`
reported "You are not authenticated"; exact local
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` variables are absent. The
operator packet's initial staging D1 ID differs from its Phase B expected ID
(which matches `wrangler.staging.jsonc`). No remote D1 list/info/ledger,
Time Travel bookmark, schema or 500-recipe authority check was performed;
do not resolve this discrepancy by selecting a likely database. Staging D1
migration, D1-mode deploy and T20 E2E were **not** executed.

The follow-up adds a manual staging-only 0039 migration workflow, fail-closed
main-SHA/CI, D1 identity, ledger, bookmark and post-schema checks, plus contract
tests. `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/staging-d1-migration-check.test.mjs
tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs
tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts` PASS (3 files / 63 tests);
`pnpm exec eslint scripts/staging-d1-migration-check.mjs
tests/unit/staging-d1-migration-check.test.mjs` PASS. Initial test attempts
failed for a test syntax typo and parsing JSONC with `JSON.parse`; both were
corrected and the full focused rerun passed. On implementation checkpoint
`9635ad6`, local `pnpm check` PASS (203 files / 4,580 tests, lint, typecheck,
migration smoke, build); hosted PR #10 `validate` run `36241921150` SUCCESS.
Independent review found two P2 test/certification gaps in the new workflow
(FK cascade assertions and preflight SQL allowlist); both were fixed on the
follow-up branch and the same 3 files / 63 tests plus targeted ESLint passed.
This later docs/review-fix head still needs its own hosted CI before PR #10
can be reviewed for merge.

Next: reviewer resolves staging D1 ID discrepancy against the real account,
reviews/merges the staging-only workflow PR through normal flow, then uses
staging Environment credentials to run its read-only gates before any ledger
apply. Require exact-main CI on the merged workflow commit. Only after 0039
certification may the release operator run D1-500/T20-OFF staging deploy,
baseline smoke, then staging V2-ON and E2E. Production remains untouched.

**Latest (2026-09-26):** PR #8 merged into `main` at `662a065` with exact-main
CI green; PR #9 is synced/retargeted to `main` at C8 `8814701`. Its docs head
`cffd959` passed exact-head hosted CI. The next section is the current checkpoint;
older entries below are historical.

## T20 PR #9 post-merge sync — 2026-09-26 UTC

PR #8 MERGED at `662a065` (hosted CI `36237334354`, `validate` SUCCESS).
Deploy run `36237637195`: release and staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED.
This is a flag-OFF staging deployment, **not** T20 staging certification;
no staging D1 migration was performed here. PR #9 remains OPEN, now targeting
`main` after merging `origin/main` at C8 `8814701`; merge-base is `662a065`.
The post-sync diff consists solely of PR #9 hardening, related regressions
and documentation: no PR #8 duplicate runtime code, migration, deploy/CI
workflow, config, T19 authority or payment/auth change. `git diff --check
origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Post-sync focused `pnpm exec vitest run` of the five
T20 integration, two T19 authority integration and three T20 unit suites:
10 files / 112 tests PASS. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and post-sync
`pnpm check` PASS (202 files / 4,574 tests, migration smoke and build).
Hosted PR #9 CI on C8 head `8814701`, run `36238249061` / validate job
`108393884945`, SUCCESS (202 files / 4,574 tests, migration smoke and build).
Docs head `cffd959` passed exact-head hosted CI `36239282586` / validate job
`108396637996`: ESLint, typecheck, Vitest, local SQLite migration smoke and
web/Worker build all SUCCESS. On that same head, `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-stale-read.test.ts
tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts` passed 2 files / 24 tests.
`git fetch origin main fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine--hardening` and
`git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD` confirmed base ancestry and
remote head equality; PR #9 was OPEN, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, with zero unresolved
review threads. This documentation receipt is a further docs-only head; verify
its own exact-head hosted CI and live review/mergeability before maintainer merge.
No migration, deployment, flag enablement or production operation was performed
for this PR #9 sync. Keep both T20 flags OFF; do not merge PR #9 in this task.

## T20 PR #9 C5–C7 checkpoint — 2026-09-26 UTC

`origin/main` remains `bf57451` (CI `36221190222` FAILED). PR #8 is open at
`16c5aae`, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, zero unresolved review threads; hosted `validate`
run `36233377483` SUCCESS. PR #9 remains stacked on its branch, now at
`869f035`; its pull_request CI does not run until its base is `main`. No PR
was merged or closed by this agent.

The independent P1 inventory-prefix bypass is fixed in PR #9: C5 `ab83d35`
rechecks the edited slot from its first changed component, `5c6835e` checks
later meals affected by the same running T02 projection, and `6c68d8d`
includes V1 family variants through the shared T03 restriction evaluator while
avoiding unrelated quantity-only rechecks. The P2 slot error precedence is
fixed by C6 `092d67b` and `869f035`: nonexistent slot 404, existing slot with
stale revision 409, including slots created during a torn read. Deterministic
reviewed substitutions were injected **only in tests**; no claim is made that
production currently configures them. Rejected writes keep the composition
and revision unchanged; unaffected prefix, safe reorders, V1 family shopping,
T19 authority and the D1 write fence remain covered.

At C7 code head `869f035`, `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, 202 Vitest
files / 4,574 tests, `migration-smoke=ok`, build. Focused `pnpm exec vitest run`
for the five T20 integration files (stale-read, legacy-family-and-safety,
HTTP, flows, picker/shopping), two T19 integration files (authority-split,
planner-authority-persistence), and three T20 unit files (composer UI,
shopping, safety) PASS: 10 files / 112 tests. `git diff --check
origin/main...HEAD` PASS. The deliberately failing regressions before the
follow-up fixes and two superseded full runs interrupted after new findings
are not final validation. This is branch-local, not hosted/exact-main evidence.

Next: maintainer merges PR #8 through its normal PR flow, verifies exact-main
CI, then syncs/retargets PR #9 to `main` and requires exact-head hosted CI,
review clearance and mergeability before its merge and a new exact-main CI.
Staging identity/ledger remain unverified; no remote 0039 migration, staging
deploy, production migration/deploy or flag enablement was performed.

## T20 PR #8 CI fix — lock/regenerate race, 2026-09-26 UTC

Final merge-readiness pass (2026-09-26 UTC): `origin/main` remains `bf57451`
(`bf57451e4a1a047eeff7a0938b903d1a37b6f8c9`), whose CI `36221190222` failed in the T20 concurrency test.
PR #8 remains open at `5b0a6b9` (`5b0a6b995786b338999286023eb2e46de4bc45a7`), MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no
unresolved review threads; exact-head hosted `validate` run `36226026618`
passed lint, typecheck, full Vitest, migration smoke and build. A fresh
`pnpm exec vitest run` of the T20 flows, picker/shopping, HTTP and composer UI
suites passed (4 files / 37 tests); `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`
passed. Its diff adds no migration, infrastructure, secret, deploy workflow or
flag change. PR #8 is ready for a normal intermediate merge by the maintainer,
not a T20 release: the existing flags remain OFF and PR #9 is stacked on #8
for revision semantics, Manual safety and picker response hardening. No remote
migration, deployment, enablement or production mutation was performed.
Next: merge #8 through the PR flow, check exact-main CI, then retarget and
certify #9 before T20 staging work.

---

PR #8 hosted `validate` run `36225377465` failed 1/4554:
`competing lock/regenerate` got `[200, 404]`. Regenerate won; the losing PATCH
targeted the unlocked legacy component, which the winning regenerate replaced.
Test-only fix (`754fb2e`): the race
now targets the locked rice component, which regenerate preserves by ID, so the
loser always reaches the revision fence (409 `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`); final
state asserted for both winners. Executed: flows file 5/5 runs PASS (16 tests);
throwaway sequential regenerate-then-stale-PATCH check PASS (409, rice still
locked; not committed); `pnpm typecheck` PASS; eslint on the file PASS.

Follow-up finding (production code NOT changed, per scope): `MealCompositionService.load`
reads the plan row and `readPlanCompositions` in separate awaits. A stale
component edit can pass `assertRevision` on the old row, then read a newer
composition and fail with 404 `COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND` before the fenced write.
Writes remain revision-fenced (no data loss); only the error classification is
wrong. Next: reclassify to `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT` when the plan revision
moved (or read row + compositions in one batch), with a regression test.

# T20 post-merge CI fix + picker cuisine filter, 2026-09-26 UTC

Branch `fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine` from main `bf57451` (PR #7 merge).
- `87c8e64` (test-only): main CI run `36221190222` failed at
  `tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-flows.test.ts:177` because the
  add/remove race can legitimately be won by DELETE (empty composition) while
  the test assumed `components[0]`. The combined race is split into three
  independent cases; each asserts exactly one 200 + one typed 409
  (`PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`; auto-apply losing to a save may be the documented
  `PROPOSAL_STALE`) and a final state matching the winner. DELETE-wins refills
  at the current revision; lock/regenerate and save/auto-apply start from a
  deterministic sequential setup. No production logic changed.
- `65084fc`: T20 picker `cuisine` query (strict enum of existing `CuisineType`
  values), filtered server-side on stored recipe cuisine together with role/q/
  kind; simple foods have no cuisine and are excluded when the filter is set.
  UI: labelled cuisine select and filtered empty state with Clear filters.
  Candidate authority, hard restrictions, composer, shopping, T19 unchanged.

Executed: focused `vitest run` of t20-meal-composer-ui, t20-roles-picker-shopping,
t20-meal-composition-flows, t20-meal-composition-http: 4 files / 37 tests PASS;
flows file 6/6 repeated runs PASS; DELETE-first sequence verified with a
throwaway sequential test (not committed). `pnpm typecheck`, lint PASS.
`pnpm check` on `65084fc`: typecheck, lint PASS; vitest 4,552 PASS / 2 FAIL —
`tests/unit/d1-readonly-query.test.mjs` and
`tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` hit the 5 s default timeout in
this sandbox (both PASS with `--testTimeout=60000`, ~6.2 s each; unrelated to
T20). Because the script stops at tests, `pnpm check:migrations`
(`migration-smoke=ok`) and `pnpm build` (`✓ built in 10.45s`) were run
separately: PASS. `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. The running-app
UI check was not performed (the T20 UI flag stays off here). Nothing merged,
deployed or migrated; production D1 not accessed; no T20 flags enabled.

Next: open a PR from this branch, confirm hosted `validate` is green (it should
no longer flake at the old line 177), then run a flag-enabled local visual check
of the picker cuisine select before any T20 release.

# T20 PR #7 — final merge-decision audit, 2026-09-26 UTC

PR #7 on `feat/t20-meal-composition-v2` was reviewed at `6882ba3` against
`main` `136cb6f`: hosted `validate` run `36217584128` SUCCESS, MERGEABLE/CLEAN,
no review comments and clean worktree. No implementation or release configuration
change was needed. `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS;
`pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs
tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts` PASS (4 files / 46 tests). Full
`pnpm check` on application head `0b465d5` previously PASS (201 files / 4,549
tests, migration smoke, build); the latest head is documentation-only and its
hosted full validation passed. Production D1 was not accessed or migrated.

Next: check CI on this documentation-only handoff head and obtain the user's
merge decision. Separately, the D1 operator must apply 0039 before deployment;
the release owner must opt in to the default-off paired Worker/UI flags only
after the target database is migrated. Neither is a merge blocker. No merge,
deploy, production mutation, T20 enablement or T19 authority change here.

# T20 PR #7 — final P2 budget remediation, 2026-09-26 UTC

**Status: `T20_PR7_READY_FOR_FINAL_REVIEW`; no merge or deployment.**
Review base: `main` at `136cb6f`; prior head `a337a2b` passed hosted `validate`
run `36216083854`. Application head `0b465d5` passed hosted `validate` run
`36216675722` (SUCCESS, MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no review comments). The
handoff head `d7aef32` passed hosted `validate` run `36217199489` (SUCCESS,
MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no review comments). No implementation changes remain. The
final audit found no new merge blockers; local `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts`
passed (4 files / 46 tests), and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` passed.
This handoff note introduces no runtime, migration or workflow changes. The
operator still has to apply 0039 before target deployment; the release owner
should enable paired server/UI flags only after migration (default off).
Application checkpoints `e3aef74` (candidate pool) and `4f60157` (scoring limit) remain on
`feat/t20-meal-composition-v2` (PR #7). Final pass commit `0b465d5` removes a
stray blank line at EOF in `src/worker/services/meal-composition.ts` (the full
PR diff had failed `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`); no runtime logic
changed. The full PR diff now passes that check.

- `prepareComposerCandidates`: T03-rank every role/authority-eligible recipe,
  reserve eligible simple foods inside the same 320 slots, fill per-role quotas
  with multi-role candidates counted once as a candidate, then backfill free
  slots in rank order. The *returned* recipe + simple-food pool never exceeds
  `COMPOSITION_BUDGET.maxCatalogCandidates` (320). No client cap input.
- `composeMeal`: score only after checking `maxScoringOperations`; cache each
  scored partial, stop before an extra operation, reuse the cached score for
  returned options. When exhausted, return already-scored compatible partials
  without touching locks. Default 2400; test overrides 1, 3 and 0.
- Focused `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts
  tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-composition-safety.test.ts
  tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-flows.test.ts
  tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts`: **6 files / 68 tests
  PASS** before the additional zero-budget case; then
  `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts`: **17 PASS**.
  `pnpm typecheck` and `git diff --check`: PASS. Full `pnpm check` **PASS**:
  typecheck, ESLint, Vitest 201 files / 4,549 tests, `migration-smoke=ok`,
  production asset build (`✓ built in 6.64s`). Remote D1 schema and Week
  parity checks skipped as configured for local verification; no production
  access or mutation. Independent narrow review found no new P0/P1/P2.
- Boundaries: no merge, no deploy, no production D1 migration or data mutation,
  no T20 flag enablement, no T19 recipe authority change. Migration 0039 remains
  unapplied by this task.

Final-pass execution on `0b465d5`: `pnpm typecheck` PASS;

# Tako-san T20 PR #7 review remediation (4 × P1 + candidate-cap P2) - 2026-09-26 UTC

**Status: `T20_REVIEW_P1_REMEDIATED` — local `pnpm check` PASS (200 files /
4,541 tests); PR #7 hosted `validate` run `36210020774` SUCCESS on head
`424be56` (MERGEABLE, CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own run). Production untouched: no
deploy, no D1 migration, T19 authority unchanged (d1/0/cutover=true, 500).**

`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2` (PR #7), review base head `febeb1f`; implementation commit `2e4f878`.

Fixed (review findings on PR #7; the earlier "P1 = 0" claim was wrong):
- P1 Manual hard safety: T03 `evaluateHardRestrictions` extracted from
  `evaluateRankingEligibility` (behaviour unchanged) is the single definition.
  New `packages/recipes/src/composition/restrictions.ts` judges every component a
  Manual mutation adds (add/swap/replace, and Assisted/Auto apply) on the same
  T02 candidate (slot inventory, planner substitution policy, server evidence
  provider) that Auto ranks: dietary/allergen unknown, time unknown/over, hard
  nutrition unknown/conflict, forbidden (incl. used substitutes), never-recommend
  → 422 `HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`. Simple foods use the same function in Auto,
  Manual and picker (Auto previously ignored time/nutrition for simple foods).
  No manual override model.
- P1 V1 family meals: composition routes (Manual/Assist/Auto) return 422
  `LEGACY_FAMILY_COMPOSITION_UNSUPPORTED` up front; the UI keeps V1 "Swap meal"
  and shows no composer for family slots. Family slots are now projected
  (`legacy_family`, exact T04 variant identity), so composed-plan shopping no
  longer drops their demand (it silently did before); an unresolvable variant is
  409 `COMPOSITION_REVALIDATION_REQUIRED`.
- P1 shopping substitution authority: `EvaluationScope` requires
  `substitutions/approvedSubstitutionIds/activeConstraints`, built by
  `evaluationScope(context)` from the same planning context as the planner and
  Auto. (The production context still supplies empty lists — no reviewed registry.)
- P1 flags: `deploy.yml` input `meal_composition_v2_enabled` (default false) →
  `release-check.mjs gate` normalizes once (manifest `mealCompositionV2Enabled`)
  → Build `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` + Worker `--var
  MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` in staging and production; `scripts/composition-flags.mjs
  verify` fails unless server/UI/manifest/compiled value (`dist/composition-flags.json`,
  written by a Vite build plugin outside `dist/client`) agree. Wrangler configs
  default `"false"`. Production build moved to its own step after local gates.
  UI falls back to V1 controls when the composition API 404s (mismatch).
- P2 candidate bias: all role-matching recipes are generated and ranked; the 320
  cap applies after ranking with a per-role quota (no catalog-order truncation).
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_SERVER=false` drills the UI-on/server-off
  mismatch in the isolated preview.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck (app + worker), lint, Vitest **200 files / 4,541
  tests** (612.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build.
- New suites: `tests/unit/t20-composition-safety.test.ts` (13),
  `tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts` (5),
  `tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs` (17), +4 UI cases in
  `tests/unit/t20-meal-composer-ui.test.tsx`. Verified to fail on the old code:
  all 5 integration cases and the 2 UI family/mismatch cases.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser, 390×844): flags on →
  composer shown, V1 swap hidden, Manual add of rice persisted; UI on/server off →
  compositions 404, V1 "Đổi món" shown, no composer. Family slot not browser-tested
  (static preview catalog has no families; covered by jsdom + HTTP tests).
- `deploy.yml` not executed on GitHub Actions (only parsed and unit-tested).

Remaining debt (not blocking): picker still lists recipes with
`constraintState: unknown` when safety is requested (server rejects on save);
role heuristics (staple 0 / dessert 0 in catalog); per-component servings.

Next: operator merge decision on PR #7 (not merged by the agent). After merge,
production Deploy fails closed until 0039 is applied through *Production D1
migration* (`expected_pre_tip=0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`,
`migration=0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`); staging D1 needs 0039 before its flag
is enabled. Automatic staging deploys ship the flag off. Then dispatch Deploy with
`meal_composition_v2_enabled=true` (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

# Tako-san T20 Meal Composition V2 - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T20_CODE_COMPLETE` — local gates PASS; PR #7 hosted CI `validate`
run `36197958265` SUCCESS on implementation head `0db541da8619fdf03f21bc4fb93d081fa335a0d5` (MERGEABLE,
CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own PR-head run). T19: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. Production
untouched: recipe authority d1/0/cutover=true, 500 recipes; no T20 deploy; no
production D1 migration.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`
`starting_main=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`
`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`

Implemented (ADR-031, `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2.md`):
- T20A: additive migration `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`
  (`generated_meal_plan_compositions`, `generated_meal_plan_components`,
  `recipe_role_assignments`; partial unique indexes for one dish per meal);
  domain model, closed role enum, deterministic role rules with provenance,
  nine bounded simple foods, flexible meal profiles, V1 read-time projection.
- T20B: server-authoritative Manual builder API (add/remove/swap/lock/role/
  reorder/replace) sharing the plan `revision` behind a batch fence; picker
  (summary DTOs, role/kind/text filters, stable offset cursor, ≤ 24/page).
- T20C/D: Assisted (complete / regenerate unlocked) and Auto (top ≤ 3) on one
  bounded, deterministic beam search; suggestions never write; apply recomputes
  and requires the same option ID; locks are domain-enforced.
- T20E: all components of all meals projected against one running T04
  inventory projection, then unchanged T05 aggregation (single subtraction).
- T20F: composed week cards, meal composer, picker bottom sheet/dialog,
  suggestion panels; vi/en; lock `aria-pressed`, one polite live region, focus
  restoration, Escape cancels without mutation.
- V1: unedited slots read as `main / legacy_v1`; V1 schemas unchanged; V1 swap
  on a composed slot is 409 `COMPOSITION_MANAGED_SLOT`; V1 regenerate keeps
  locked components; V1 shopping projects components. Flag off = pre-T20.
- Flags: `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (server) and
  `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (UI), both default off, independent of T19.
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2=true node scripts/security-preview.mjs`
  opts the isolated preview into V2 (default off keeps the T06B browser suite).

Role distribution on the 500-recipe D1 release (pinned test): main 362, side
87, soup 70, vegetable 37, simple_food 7, staple 0, dessert 0; unclassified 0,
invalid 0, duplicates 0, contradictions 0, review-required 0.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19, sqlite3):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, Vitest **197 files / 4,502 tests**
  (725.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build. T20 suites: 6 files / 48 tests; T19
  authority suites (split 11, persistence 18, observability 19) PASS;
  d1-schema-gate 9 PASS.
- Earlier full run: 4,496/4,497 with one unrelated 5 s timeout in
  `production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` under parallel load; that file passed
  48/48 in isolation and in the final `pnpm check`.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser): 375×812, 390×844,
  768×1024, 1280×900 — plan generation, V1 cards, composer, Auto options and
  accept, picker keyboard focus/Escape return, no horizontal overflow, no
  unnamed controls.

Not done / deferred: leftovers (T20B/T21), per-component servings, role review
tooling and AI-assisted offline role proposals, picker ingredient/cuisine
filters, whole-week Auto, price-aware scoring. `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json`
gets the 0039 hash only after the migration is applied (fixture policy).

Next: independent review of PR #7 (not merged by the agent); require exact-head
hosted `validate` on the final head.
Rollout (separately authorized): apply 0039 to staging then production D1 (the
schema gate fails closed on a 0038 ledger), then enable both flags. Do not change
T19 recipe authority.

# Historical T19 operator closure / T20 unlocked - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. T20: `UNLOCKED`.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`
`main_baseline=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f` (PR #6 merge)

T19 closure was accepted by the operator based on the successful final D1
deployment, the rollback proof, the final restoration, exact-main CI, the
existing production read-only certification and runtime release evidence.
The evidence below is operator-reported for runs on the same main SHA; this
agent did not re-run or re-read those production runs in this task.

- Exact-main CI `36149295615` SUCCESS; current-main staging `36149849086`
  SUCCESS.
- Production sequence: shadow `36150427552`, canary-1 `36151130515`,
  canary-5 `36152198646`, canary-25 `36153116467`, first d1 `36153948951`
  (all SUCCESS).
- Rollback proof `36154980456` SUCCESS (d1 → shadow): PASS.
- Final restore: canary-1 `36167843671`, canary-5 `36176092421`, canary-25
  `36176824421`, final d1 `36183890785` (all SUCCESS): PASS.
- Final production authority: `mode=d1`, `percent=0`, `cutover=true`,
  `source=d1`, served recipes `500`, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`,
  `fallback=null`, runtime fingerprint `f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`.

**The final post-rollout read-only recertification was waived by the
operator. No post-final-D1 certification run occurred; do not invent a PASS
receipt for it.**

T20 (Meal Composition V2) is unlocked and implemented on
`feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`; see the T20 section above this one once it is
recorded. T20 must not change production recipe authority (d1/0/true, 500).

# Historical T19 same-SHA promotion convergence fix - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_D1_PROMOTION_CONVERGENCE_FIX_IN_REVIEW`. Production is at
`canary-25` on main `a3e1614` (`a3e161470e3757f9a211bd443f560cb139c8654f`); the d1 promotion
was rolled back automatically. T19 incomplete; T20 blocked.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

After PR #5 merged, the owner ran shadow bootstrap and promotions on
`a3e1614`: Deploy `36140227253` (shadow), `36141391948` (canary-1),
`36142331814` (canary-5) and `36143861402` (canary-25) all SUCCESS;
certification `36139684859` PASS on that SHA.

d1 promotion `36144837880` (transition `canary-25 → d1`, kind `promotion`):
deploy succeeded, then the proof step failed after ~4 s with `FAIL readiness:
recipe authority mode canary != approved d1`. `wait-for-deployed-release.mjs`
logged `attempt 1: readiness identifies release a3e16147` — it verified only
the commit, and the old and new Worker versions share that commit (only vars
differ), so it returned while the edge still answered from the canary-25
version. Restore then ran: its first check logged `Rollback authority
evidence differs at configuredMode` (the d1 version still answering), the
existing 180 s loop retried, and the receipt records `rollback.result =
restored`, exact previous version `8076dfe6-138f-4084-825e-7b4e6e46dad4`, new deployment
`398ee771-e6c4-447d-b01e-7ce62d22e4cc`. The restore step concluded SUCCESS (the report's
claim that the rollback proof failed is not supported by the run). The
earlier promotions all passed at `attempt 1` too, so the race was latent.

Fix (scripts only; workflow YAML unchanged):
- `verifyDeployedRelease` also requires the readiness `recipeAuthority`
  mode/percent/cutover to equal the manifest. A mismatch is retryable
  (`RELEASE_PROPAGATION_PENDING`) only when it is a valid state equal to the
  preflight-captured `previousRecipeAuthority` for the same commit (staging,
  without preflight evidence: any valid state, still bounded); invalid,
  contradictory or unexpected states and a missing summary fail at once.
- `wait-for-deployed-release.mjs` requires 3 consecutive matching readiness
  observations (old-version answers reset the count), within the existing
  90 s deadline.
- `release-check.mjs authority` polls via `waitForRecipeAuthorityEvidence`,
  retrying only evidence equal to the pre-deploy state on the same commit
  (90 s); fallback, other states or other commits fail immediately; with no
  preflight evidence (staging) behaviour stays single-attempt.
- The restore loop already tolerates this race and is unchanged.

Checks: run/job/step timings, bounded logs and receipt of `36144837880`;
logs of `36141391948`/`36142331814`/`36143861402`; focused Vitest
(`wait-for-deployed-release` + `release-check`) 198 PASS with new
regressions; full `pnpm check` PASS (lint, typecheck, 191 files / 4,453 tests, migration
smoke, build).

Next: review/merge. This moves main, so the same-SHA rule restarts the
rollout: new-main CI → staging → read-only certification → production
`shadow` on the new SHA with `confirm_recipe_catalog_rollback=true`
(`validateRecipeCatalogTransition` classifies canary-25 → shadow as a
rollback; the 25 % cohort returns to the static catalog until canary resumes)
→ canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1 → rollback proof → final d1.

# Historical T19 legacy-Worker bootstrap fix - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_PRODUCTION_BOOTSTRAP_FIX_IN_REVIEW`. Production Worker is
still pre-T19 `4677ebb` (`4677ebbabbb580b9045423350da719acaf8f5742`); no production deploy has
succeeded. T19 incomplete; T20 blocked.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Owner production shadow bootstrap Deploy `36133649176` (main `8603808`)
failed at preflight: `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN must be provisioned before
deployment`. Owner then provisioned the production GitHub Environment secret
and the `frigo` Worker secret (value not seen by the agent). Re-dispatch
`36134994434` passed local gates, CI recheck, Cloudflare identity, schema
0001–0038, runtime catalog 500 and release certification, then failed:
`Recipe authority preflight failed with HTTP 401`. Neither run reached
`Deploy to Cloudflare production`; receipts have no `deployed` field.

Cause: `4677ebb` has no `/health/recipe-authority` route (added in
`8205883`); its global auth middleware answers 401 before routing, while the
preflight only accepted 200 or 404 (bootstrap). The reviewer's proposed
match on `"code":"UNAUTHORIZED"` would still fail: that code is only returned
without a Bearer header. With the workflow's Bearer token the legacy Worker
returns `TOKEN_INVALID` (verified by read-only GETs: no header →
`UNAUTHORIZED`, dummy Bearer → `TOKEN_INVALID`; new staging Worker with
dummy Bearer → `RELEASE_VERIFY_UNAUTHORIZED`). The restore step had the same
gap: after rolling back to the legacy Worker it would retry 401 until timeout
and fail the rollback proof.

Fix (not body matching): new `release-check.mjs legacy-authority` accepts a
preflight 401 as `{unavailable:true,httpStatus:401,legacyWorkerCommit}` only
when the exact snapshotted Worker version (pinned D1 binding) carries a full
`GIT_COMMIT` that is an ancestor of the release and whose
`src/worker/routes/health.ts` lacks `/health/recipe-authority`; a
`RELEASE_VERIFY_UNAUTHORIZED` body always fails. It runs after
`rollback-target` and before `transition`, so the existing bootstrap rules
still apply (static/shadow only, explicit confirmation required). Restore
accepts 401 only when the previous evidence was that proven legacy Worker and
the body is not `RELEASE_VERIFY_UNAUTHORIZED`; exact previous version, new
deployment ID, binding and mutation receipt are still required.

Checks: bounded failed logs of both runs; `git show 4677ebb:` middleware and
health route; read-only production/staging GETs without real tokens;
classifier against real history (`4677ebb` accepted; `8205883` and main
rejected); `bash -n` of the modified workflow steps plus branch simulation;
focused Vitest 3 files / 228 PASS; `pnpm check` PASS (lint, typecheck,
191 files / 4,440 tests, migration smoke, build). The GitHub App push now
succeeds for workflow files.

Next: review/merge the PR; confirm exact-new-main CI and automatic staging
PASS; rerun Production Read-Only Certification on the new SHA; owner
re-dispatches production shadow bootstrap with the new full SHA as `ref` and
`hardened_sha` (other inputs unchanged). Then canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1,
rollback proof, final restoration. No other main merges during rollout.

Then, one run each on the same SHA with the checkbox **off**: canary 1 → 5 →

# Historical T19 exact patch handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`. The exact implementation
commit `399ec9b` is ready to hand to an authorized maintainer as a standalone
patch; no branch or PR was published from this workspace. T19/T20 blocked;
production certification remains failed, no production mutation.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Owner requested the patch so their reviewer can apply it from current main.
Verified `git format-patch -1 399ec9b --stdout` contains only six files:
the two reviewed workflows, `.hoplite/setup.sh`, the fixed read-only D1 query
runner and two unit-test files. Its parent is local documentation on top of
the unchanged `origin/main=f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, so `git diff main...399ec9b`
would include unrelated historical docs. The **single-commit** patch was
validated by `git diff --check 399ec9b^ 399ec9b` and `git apply --check -`
in a fresh archive of `origin/main` (both PASS). No secrets or unrelated
PayOS/auth/payment files were present. The user-facing reply includes the
entire standalone implementation diff; the recipient must apply it in a
review branch through their authorized GitHub path, with tests and normal
review. A patch handed off in chat is not published or certified.

Next: authorized maintainer applies the exact single-commit diff to current
main, opens PR for review, and verifies CI. After merge, require new-SHA
staging PASS and a new read-only production certification with required
reviewer. No D1 migration/rollout or T20 before those gates.

# Historical T19 workflow publication permission gate - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`. Production read-only

T19 and T20 blocked; no production mutation by this work.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Local branch `hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` has implementation checkpoint
`399ec9b` and handoff checkpoint `17ab64c`. Full `pnpm check` PASS (191
files / 4,432 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build). After confirming
the active managed GitHub App credential matched repository ID `1385308553`,
`git push origin HEAD:hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` was **remote rejected**:
`refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
.github/workflows/deploy.yml without workflows permission`. No remote branch
or PR was created; main remains `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`. A read-only installation
metadata API probe returned 401 (`A JSON web token could not be decoded`),
not evidence of a new credential; the Git rejection is the permission proof.
No stripping of workflow edits, ad-hoc prod query, manual deploy or workaround
that bypasses access control was attempted. Pre-existing `.context/` is
untracked and untouched.

Next: an authorized GitHub App integration must gain **workflow-file write**
permission for this repository (through the provider's approved permission
path), or an authorized human maintainer must publish/review this exact tested
patch. Do not request or exchange tokens. After a successful review/merge,
require exact-new-main CI and staging before a **new** production read-only
certification run with reviewer approval; no migration or rollout yet. This
workspace cannot claim the repair is deployed or production is certified.

Executed for this gate: `credential_control status` (active, correct repo ID);
`git push origin HEAD:hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` (rejected, no ref),
`git ls-remote origin refs/heads/hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` (absent),

# Historical T19 production read-only certification query repair - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_PRODUCTION_READ_ONLY_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED`. Production
certification did not pass; no production mutation or rollout by this change.
T20 remains blocked. The previous staging PASS applies only to main
`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, not to any future main commit.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Owner-dispatched Production Read-Only Certification run `36101940395`
(attempt 1, `workflow_dispatch`, head `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`) completed FAILURE after
production Environment approval. `gate`, `Recheck exact main`, SQL generator/
guard and production identity/rollback baseline steps succeeded. In the
read-only schema/catalog step, `bash scripts/d1-schema-gate.sh remote` reported
PASS for the exact repository 0001–0038 migration ledger, security/Week and
recipe schema, and foreign keys. The immediately following
`pnpm wrangler d1 execute frigo-db --remote --yes --json --file
schema-gate.sql` returned exit 1; no bounded log error details were emitted.
The failure receipt artifact `production-certification-36101940395-1`
contains a production Worker baseline but **no** `certification.result=PASS`,
catalog, runtime, quick-check, final ledger or complete production readiness
proof. It cannot certify production or prove that D1 already contains the
500-recipe release. No new production credential, migration, deploy or write
was performed.

Root cause of the *workflow design* is independently confirmed in the pinned
Wrangler `3.114.17` code: remote `--file` calls D1 `/import`, which can block
the DB and returns an import summary instead of SELECT rows; remote
`--command` calls D1 `/query`. The exact reason this particular `/import`
call exited 1 was not exposed by the runner, so do not attribute that exit to
an unproven Wrangler-version bug, Cloudflare outage or permission defect.
Merely changing the schema command would still leave two unsafe `--file`
queries for catalog (2 statements) and runtime content (5 statements).

Reviewable repair: `scripts/d1-readonly-query.mjs` accepts only three fixed
generated proof names (`schema`, `catalog`, `runtime-catalog`), checks exact
statement counts and read-only SQL before any request, executes each SELECT
using Wrangler's remote `--command` query path, rejects incomplete/malformed
or unsuccessful JSON and writes an ordered receipt only after all queries
succeed. Production certification now calls it for all three proofs; the
existing production Deploy preflight also uses it for the runtime content
proof. Independent schema/ledger/catalog/fingerprint/integrity verifiers,
immutable exact-main/CI gates and Environment reviewer approval remain
unchanged. Workflow/runner source is fingerprint-pinned and covered by
positive and mutation-negative tests. Wrangler dependency was not upgraded.
Missing workspace sqlite3 CLI was repaired with `.hoplite/setup.sh` (idempotent
apt install plus frozen pnpm install), proven by `sandbox_control setup`.
Tracked `.hoplite/settings.json` was not changed or staged.

Checks: `gh api` run/jobs/artifact GET for `36101940395`; bounded
`gh run view 36101940395 --log-failed`; safe receipt inspection;
`git fetch origin --prune --quiet` and exact-main API (still
`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`); pinned Wrangler local source `--file`/`--command` call-path
inspection; `pnpm wrangler --version` (`3.114.17`); focused Vitest
(5 files / 260 tests PASS); `pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS;
`git diff --check` PASS. Initial `pnpm check:migrations` failed only because
sqlite3 CLI was missing; setup installed it, then
`pnpm check:migrations` PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`). Full `pnpm check`
PASS: lint, typecheck, **191 test files / 4,432 tests**, migration smoke
and build (`ALL CHECKS PASSED SUCCESSFULLY`). Implementation checkpoint:
`399ec9b` (query runner/workflows/tests/setup); handoff docs follow in a
separate checkpoint. No live production query was run by the agent.

Next: review and merge the scoped workflow repair via PR, require green
exact-new-main CI and a fresh exact-SHA staging PASS after merge. Only then
dispatch the read-only production certification on the new main SHA with
approved hardening SHA and required production reviewer; examine the complete
PASS artifact and unchanged production baseline before any separately
authorized migration or rollout. A rerun of old workflow run `36101940395`
would still use the old SHA and cannot certify this repair. T20 remains blocked.

# Historical T19 current-main staging certification - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_OWNER_TRANSFER_CONTROL_PLANE_MISMATCH` for production
read-only certification dispatch: GitHub App lacks Actions write. Current-main
staging: `PASS`; production certification: `NOT STARTED`; T19 and T20:
`BLOCKED`. No production mutation.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

After the owner updated the staging secret and retried Deploy
`36018964086`, attempt 2 was `SKIPPED` for all three jobs: release/staging/
production had no steps and no candidate artifact for that attempt. This did
not certify staging; the exact reason the historical workflow-run release
condition evaluated false on rerun is unproven. No workflow bypass or main
change was made. The owner then dispatched the **reviewed manual staging path**
as Deploy run `36092413084` attempt 1, event `workflow_dispatch`, on exact
main `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`), actor `tako-vn1`.

Deploy `36092413084` completed SUCCESS: release SUCCESS, staging SUCCESS,
production SKIPPED. Every staging step completed SUCCESS, including Worker
secret-list preflight (previously Cloudflare code 10000), build, exact-main
CI recheck, staging deploy, exact-SHA receipt, post-deploy smoke and protected
recipe-authority proof. Inspected its attempt-scoped
`release-staging-36092413084-1` artifact: repository
`tako-vn1/Tako-san`, CI `36018278513`, exact deploy and main SHA
`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, environment `staging`, configured mode `static`, canary `0`,
cutover `false`, actual/global source `static`, served count `71`, release ID
`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, fallback `null`. Its D1 readiness is `not_evaluated` in
static mode; the 500-recipe production D1 state is **not** certified by this.
Bounded hosted smoke log confirms readiness `ok`, database `ok`, environment
`staging`, authority proof PASS, no fallback and smoke PASS.

The GitHub commits API and refreshed `origin/main` still match that staged
release. The existing Production Read-Only Certification workflow is active,
manual/main-only, and gated by the `production` Environment, which still lists
required reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung`. Prepared its immutable full `ref` and
approved `hardened_sha` from the verified staging receipt (no synthetic SHAs).
`gh workflow run .github/workflows/production-certify.yml -R
tako-vn1/Tako-san --ref main -f ref=<receipt.sha> -f
hardened_sha=<receipt.hardenedSha> -f
confirm_read_only_certification=true` was refused before dispatch: HTTP 403
`Resource not accessible by integration`. No certification run exists and no
production D1/Worker/ledger/rollback facts have been verified. Do not call
staging PASS a production certification.

Next: owner uses the GitHub Actions UI to run **Production Read-Only
Certification** from `main`, entering the exact full `sha` and `hardenedSha`
from run `36092413084` artifact `release-staging-36092413084-1`
(`release-manifest.json`), with `confirm_read_only_certification=true`.
The Environment's required reviewer must approve that **read-only** job; never
bypass approval. Inspect the resulting PASS receipt (`readOnly=true`,
`productionMutations=[]`) and live account/Worker/D1/ledger/catalog/integrity
before any migration or rollout. If the UI cannot dispatch or the certificate
fails, hold and report the specific gate. T20 remains blocked.

Executed checks: `gh api` run/attempt/job/artifact GETs for `36018964086`
and `36092413084`; `gh run download 36092413084` for candidate and staging
receipt into temporary directories with explicit safe-field inspection;
`gh run view 36092413084 --log` filtered to smoke/authority markers;
`git fetch origin --prune --quiet`; exact-main GitHub commits API and CI
`36018278513`; production Environment reviewer and certification workflow
GETs; `gh workflow run production-certify.yml` (HTTP 403, no run).
No local tests were rerun because application/workflow code did not change.

# Historical T19 staging retry permission checkpoint - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_OWNER_TRANSFER_CONTROL_PLANE_MISMATCH` (installation
cannot rerun GitHub Actions). Staging secret update reported by owner but not
independently readable. T19 and T20: `BLOCKED`. No production mutation.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Owner reported securely creating and setting the staging Cloudflare API token
on 2026-09-25. GitHub Environment secret metadata is still inaccessible to
this installation (`gh secret list -R tako-vn1/Tako-san --env staging`: HTTP
403), so token type, scope, value and update time cannot be independently
verified here. The only safe test is the existing fail-closed staging workflow.
`git fetch origin --prune --quiet`, repository/commit API and CI run
`36018278513` confirm same canonical ID, main `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, protected
`validate` SUCCESS. Latest Deploy `36018964086`, event `workflow_run`, SHA
`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, had release SUCCESS, staging FAILURE on Cloudflare code 10000,
production SKIPPED. It remains `run_attempt=1`. The reviewed Deploy workflow
on `origin/main` matches the local file. A full-run retry (necessary to
regenerate the attempt-scoped release artifact) using
`gh run rerun 36018964086 -R tako-vn1/Tako-san` failed immediately:
`run 36018964086 cannot be rerun; Resource not accessible by integration`.
Re-read run metadata: attempt 1 still complete/failed. **No staging or
production deployment was initiated in this retry.** Local OAuth is scoped to
user/account read only; `pnpm wrangler secret list --config
wrangler.staging.jsonc --format json` also cannot read Worker metadata (`No
access to the specified resource`). No ad-hoc deployment was attempted.

Next authorized action: owner opens
`https://github.com/tako-vn1/Tako-san/actions/runs/36018964086` and selects
**Re-run jobs → Re-run all jobs** (not failed jobs only, to recreate the release
artifact). This original `workflow_run` event was triggered by successful
push/main CI and can only run staging; production's YAML gate requires a
separate manual production dispatch. After owner initiates the retry, read
run attempt/job/artifact and exact-SHA staging authority/smoke receipt before
any production certification. If the retry again fails, inspect the bounded
failed step and hold. Do not create a docs-only main commit as a substitute
for missing Actions write; do not start T20.

Checks this checkpoint: `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`;
`git diff origin/main -- .github/workflows/deploy.yml` (no diff);
`gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san` (ID/default branch);
`gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main --jq .sha`;
`gh run view 36018278513`; `gh run list --workflow Deploy`;
`gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/actions/runs/36018964086` (attempt 1);
`gh secret list -R tako-vn1/Tako-san --env staging` (403);
`gh run rerun 36018964086 -R tako-vn1/Tako-san` (permission denied);
read-only Wrangler `whoami` and Worker secret-list probe (access denied).
Application code/workflows unchanged; no local app tests run.

# Historical T19 Cloudflare login checkpoint - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_STAGING_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_REQUIRED`. T19: `BLOCKED`;
T20: `BLOCKED`. No staging credential was replaced or deployment dispatched;
production unchanged.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

Follow-up after owner authorized the agent to proceed (2026-09-25 UTC):
`credential_control rotate` minted a fresh authorized GitHub installation
credential for this repository, but `gh api
repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/environments/staging/secrets` and the Actions policy
GET still return HTTP 403 (`Resource not accessible by integration`). Cloudflare
`pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 whoami` still reports only `user:read`,
`account:read` and `offline_access`; no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is available in
the workspace and Wrangler offers no `API Tokens Write` OAuth scope. `gh api
repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main --jq .sha` remains `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`; the
latest Deploy remains failed run `36018964086`. The owner's authorization does
not itself change service-issued permissions. No token creation, GitHub secret
write or workflow dispatch was attempted. Continue only after an approved
Cloudflare token-management credential **and** GitHub Environment Secrets write
permission are actually available through an authorized integration, or after
the owner securely creates the dedicated token and updates the staging secret
in the two providers' dashboards. Never request or paste credentials in chat.

The owner approved a fresh Cloudflare device login using transient Wrangler
`4.119.0`, without changing the repository-pinned Wrangler. The command
`pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device --browser=false --scopes user:read account:read`
succeeded. A sanitized `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 whoami` confirmed the account
ID matching the earlier deployment record (`ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`); the granted OAuth
scopes are `user:read`, `account:read` and `offline_access`. This is **not**
authorization to manage API tokens or Workers. Cloudflare's `POST /user/tokens`
requires `API Tokens Write`; Wrangler device OAuth does not offer that scope.
The login token must not be copied into a GitHub secret as a durable deployment
credential. No Worker secret metadata, staging D1 identity or deployment was
verified through this limited OAuth session. The managed GitHub App CLI can
access the canonical repository but is not a user CLI session; its inability to
return `gh api user` does **not** establish that the owner lacks a GitHub browser
login. Earlier `TAKOSAN_GITHUB_LOGIN_REQUIRED` wording below is historical and
was too strong as a claim about the owner's browser session.

Current `main` remained `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`) by GitHub commits API.
Exact-main CI `36018278513` passed, but Deploy `36018964086` still failed
staging preflight with Cloudflare authentication code `10000`; no current-main
staging certification exists. Owner action needed: in the Cloudflare dashboard
create a **dedicated durable staging** API token limited to the deployment
account and Worker-scripts write access (which covers the secret-list read and
upload operations), then set **only** the GitHub `staging` Environment
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` through a secure secret-management UI. Do not place the
value in chat, a terminal log, docs or repository files. The current installation
cannot read or edit GitHub Environment secrets. Verify the token's actual scope
and staging account/Worker/D1 identity before retrying the reviewed Deploy path;
do not touch the other staging secrets or production. T20 stays blocked.

Checks: `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 --version` (4.119.0), `login --help`
(`--device` available), `login --scopes-list` (no token-management scope), device
login and sanitized `whoami` PASS; `gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main
--jq .sha` returned `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`; `gh auth status` shows managed installation.
`git status --short --branch` showed only pre-existing untracked `.context/`.
`git diff --check` and assertions for all three current T19 document identities,
blockers and historical records passed. No application tests were rerun,
because code and workflows were not changed.

# Historical T19 owner-transfer takeover - 2026-09-24 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_GITHUB_LOGIN_REQUIRED`; staging also requires a durable
Cloudflare API token. T19: `BLOCKED`. T20: `BLOCKED`. No production mutation was
performed in this takeover.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

The owner was transferred from `vn-tako4` to `tako-vn1`; the numeric repository
ID and Git history were preserved. `origin` already points to
`https://github.com/tako-vn1/Tako-san.git`; `git fetch origin --prune` and the
GitHub commits API agree that current `main` is `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`),
also the local branch base. PRs #1-#3 remain merged in this repository, and the
CI run's repository and head-repository both identify ID `1385308553`.

The workspace's managed `gh` installation reports account `x-access-token`,
not a user session as `tako-vn1`; `gh api user --jq .login` returns HTTP 403
(`Resource not accessible by integration`). Do not log out or overwrite the
managed installation token. A human-approved `tako-vn1` user login in an
authorized CLI context is still needed to satisfy the requested account gate.
The current installation also gets HTTP 403 reading Actions policy, workflow
token permissions, full branch-protection settings, repository/environment
variable names, repository/environment secret names, and webhooks; app
installation lookup returns HTTP 401. Their post-transfer settings/secret names
are **unverified**, not presumed missing. The accessible branch endpoint says
`main` is protected and requires the GitHub Actions `validate` check (App ID
15368); visible repository rulesets and effective branch rules return `[]`.
Both Environments exist. Production still lists required reviewer
`vn-taphoanhatung`, whose repository permission API reports `write`; staging has
no reviewer gate. Re-audit inaccessible policy and secret inventory with owner
authorization before release.

Exact-main CI `36018278513` (`push/main`, SHA `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`) passed `validate`:
ESLint, typecheck, 190 test files / 4,415 tests, migration smoke and build.
Last successful staging receipt was Deploy `36009510442` at
`d6204d91b1849bf98df89c1c590e74395c494c89` (release/staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED); that receipt
does **not** certify current main. Latest Deploy `36018964086` at
`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` has release SUCCESS, staging FAILURE, production SKIPPED.
Its failed step, `Require staging proof configuration before deployment`,
shows Wrangler's read-only `/workers/scripts/frigo-staging/secrets` request
rejected with Cloudflare authentication code `10000`. Build, exact-head recheck,
Cloudflare deployment and smoke were skipped. Do not claim that current main was
deployed. No Cloudflare credential or Wrangler OAuth session is available in
this workspace; no staging token was created or replaced, and no Cloudflare
account/Worker/D1 identity was remotely verified here. Pinned configuration
names `frigo-staging` / `frigo-db-staging-v3` and production `frigo` /
`frigo-db`; the current catalog manifest expects 500 recipes (71 static).

Read-only checks: `gh auth status`; `git remote -v`; `git fetch origin --prune`;
`gh api user --jq .login` (HTTP 403); `gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san`;
`gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main --jq .sha`;
`gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/branches/main`; Environment, reviewer,
Actions policy, protection, rules, variable and secret-name GETs (limitations
above); `gh run view 36018278513` and `36018964086` including job steps and
failed logs; `gh run list --workflow Deploy`; `git status --short`; release
manifest and Wrangler config inspection. No local test/build was executed:
application and workflow code were not changed. `git diff --check` passed;
`python3` assertions passed for current identity, T20/blocker markers and
preserved historical references in all three current operational docs.

Next: establish the `tako-vn1` CLI identity through approved browser login;
with authorized Cloudflare access, issue a dedicated durable staging API token
with only reviewed workflow permissions, verify account/Worker/D1 identities,
and replace **only** the staging Environment `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. Re-audit
inaccessible owner-transfer controls, then re-run the existing reviewed Deploy
path for exact current main and require staging PASS before requesting the
production read-only certification/Environment approval. Do not start T20.

# Historical pre-transfer T19 release-control snapshot - 2026-09-25

**Status: `TAKOSAN_STAGING_BLOCKED`. Exact-main CI: `GREEN`.
Production: `UNTOUCHED`.
T20: `BLOCKED`.**

The canonical repository is `vn-tako4/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`). PR #1,
`ops(t19): add fail-closed production read-only certification`, merged normally
from `ops/t19-production-cert-pr-prep` into `main` at `2026-09-24T13:55:01Z`.
Its reviewed head was `0899c49a28906d09f1a51b8afe2c72e09c860f18`; the T19
application merge commit is `d6204d91b1849bf98df89c1c590e74395c494c89`, with
parents `a4b5d726` and `0899c49a`.

PR-head CI run `36007943241` passed `validate`. Real exact-main CI run
`36009002161` was created at `2026-09-24T13:55:05Z`, four seconds after the merge,
with event `push`, branch `main`, and exact SHA `d6204d91`; it passed lint,
typecheck, 190 files / 4,415 tests, migration smoke and build. The earlier
observation that this SHA had zero runs was a stale post-merge snapshot taken
before GitHub created the run, not a scheduler or control-plane defect. The merge
actor was the human account `vn-tako4`; the active CI workflow already existed on
pre-merge main, its `push` filter included `main`, no skip directive was present,
Actions was enabled with allowed actions `all`, and strict required context
`validate` remained bound to the GitHub Actions App.

Successful exact-main CI automatically triggered Deploy run `36009510442` through
the reviewed `workflow_run` path. The release and staging jobs succeeded and the
production job was skipped. Its machine receipt proves deployed SHA `d6204d91`,
environment `staging`, recipe mode `static`, canary `0`, cutover `false`, actual
and global source `static`, 71 served recipes and `fallbackReason=null`. No manual
Deploy dispatch was used.

Documentation recovery PR #2 merged at
`a86ed095ba77d1e3e1ba549ee5b28240d50ba731`. Exact-main CI run `36016668591`
was created two seconds after that merge and passed `validate`. Deploy run
`36017207468` was then created automatically through `workflow_run`; its release
job passed and production was skipped, but staging failed closed before build or
deployment. Wrangler's read-only Worker-secret lookup returned Cloudflare
`Authentication error [code: 10000]` for the stored GitHub staging
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. The three staging secret names are present, and the local
Wrangler OAuth session can refresh and list the existing Worker
`RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`; therefore the stored GitHub access-token snapshot is no
longer valid. No `a86ed095` deployment occurred. Staging remains healthy on the
previous exact deployment `d6204d91`, with public readiness `ok`, database `ok`,
mode `static`, canary `0`, cutover `false` and null fallback.

The T19 production read-only certification workflow remains available but was not
dispatched. Production deploy, production D1 migration, production secret
mutation, production traffic change and rollback remain `NONE`. T20 remains
blocked. Existing dependency-audit findings, the Wrangler OAuth credential that
must be replaced with a dedicated durable least-privilege token, and `usehoplite`
queued suites with zero check runs remain separate residuals; none is the
protected `validate` context.

Next: provision a durable staging Cloudflare API token through authorized
Cloudflare controls, replace only the staging Environment
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and re-run the reviewed automatic staging path against the
same exact-main lineage. Handle production prerequisites and Production Read-Only
Certification as a separate, explicitly authorized task. Do not start rollout or
T20 automatically.

# Historical T19 production read-only certification workflow - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_PRODUCTION_CERT_WORKFLOW_PR_PENDING`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository `1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`; starting main is
`a4b5d7268537e88c3d2e31d418fc2e3691597b80`, with exact-main CI `35817133131`
PASS. Deploy `35817440484`, attempt 2, is SUCCESS: release/staging passed and
production was skipped. Its machine receipt proves exact-main staging in
static/0/cutover=false, static source, 71 served recipes, release
`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, null fallback. Staging D1 readiness is `not_evaluated`,
not production D1 certification. Earlier secret-blocker entries below are historical.

Added `.github/workflows/production-certify.yml`: manual dispatch on main only,
explicit read-only confirmation and approved hardening SHA, existing release
gate/exact-SHA CI, pinned checkout, production Environment approval, and read-only
GitHub permissions. It reuses the existing config/identity/schema/catalog/runtime/
integrity verifiers without changing application, migration or release tooling.
Only metadata reads, guarded SELECTs (including the existing schema CTE), and
`foreign_key_check`/`quick_check` are executed remotely. Worker/account/binding
proof captures a future rollback baseline without changing traffic. Final ledger,
Worker stability and current-main/CI rechecks precede the PASS receipt.

Only `release-manifest.json` is uploaded. Raw identity/binding/catalog data stay
in the Actions workspace; account identity is hashed in the receipt. Authority
remains `UNKNOWN_RELEASE_SECRET_NOT_AVAILABLE`: this path does not request the
verification secret and does not certify the production secret pair. A PASS is
read-only evidence, not rollout authorization. The existing Cloudflare credential
may have broader privileges; the safety guarantee is the reviewed command/SQL
surface and regression guard, not a new IAM restriction. SQL filtering is
conservative, not a general-purpose SQL parser. Certification shares Deploy's
production concurrency group; migration workflow remains unchanged. Operators
must not run that separate migration workflow during certification: the final
ledger check is point-in-time evidence, not a lock against subsequent mutations.

Verification executed: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; `pnpm lint`;
`pnpm typecheck`; `node scripts/d1-migration-check.mjs config`; and
`pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs
tests/unit/release-check.test.mjs tests/unit/d1-migration-check.test.mjs
tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts` (**236/236**, including 41 workflow
safety tests). `pnpm check:migrations` initially failed because sqlite3 was
absent; applying the existing `.hoplite/settings.json` sqlite setup repaired it.
Repeated migration smoke and `pnpm build` PASS; `git diff --check` and `bash -n`
on all eight workflow shell blocks PASS. The additional `pnpm test` full-suite
attempt exceeded the 600-second sandbox command budget (exit 124); it is not
claimed as a pass. Focused checks above were rerun on the final workflow. Hosted
PR-head CI remains required for the complete suite. No Cloudflare calls, deploy,
migration, secret change, rollback or other production mutation was performed.

Publication attempted from `hoplite/akanthos-df8cfb50` at local implementation
commit `aee4e2e`. `git push origin HEAD:hoplite/akanthos-df8cfb50` was rejected:
GitHub refuses a GitHub App creating/updating
`.github/workflows/production-certify.yml` without `workflows` permission.
The subsequent `gh pr create` failed because the remote head branch does not
exist. **No PR exists and no new hosted CI ran.** No alternate publication route
was attempted. Local work is retained; no default-branch change occurred.

Next: an operator must grant/approve Workflows write permission for the authorized
repository GitHub App installation, then retry this branch push and narrow PR.
Do not provide credentials in chat or bypass the App. Require exact-head hosted
CI and review; an authorized maintainer must merge. Then require new exact-main
CI and dispatch only Production Read-Only Certification
with that full SHA, the owner-approved hardening SHA and confirmation. Respect
production Environment review. Do not dispatch Deploy or Production D1 Migration.
Production rollout remains blocked until live certification and its separate
prerequisites pass. T19 is incomplete; T20 NOT STARTED.

# Release-secret provisioning receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_RELEASE_SECRET_PROVISIONING_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`; `origin/main` is
`c0c8e82ac9bdb3167de4e5774c90cbd364b5ff92` (PR #54 merge), unchanged since exact-main CI
`35815588844` PASS. Current `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` requires, before any
staging deployment, GitHub effective secret `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`
(>= 32 chars) plus staging Worker `frigo-staging` secret `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`;
production requires GitHub effective `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` plus the production
Worker `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`.

Automatic Deploy run `35815905652` (head `c0c8e82`): release job SUCCESS,
staging job FAILED at "Require staging proof configuration before deployment",
production skipped. Runtime evidence from that job (not a 403 inference): the
step env rendered `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` empty while `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` rendered masked, so GitHub effective
`STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` is MISSING and Cloudflare credentials are PRESENT
in the staging Environment. Staging Worker `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` is UNKNOWN
(preflight stopped before `wrangler secret list`; this workspace has no
Cloudflare credential). GitHub secret metadata reads return HTTP 403 and this
installation cannot write secrets, so neither half of the pair can be
provisioned here. Operator action: generate one >= 32-byte random value, set it
as GitHub staging `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` and as `frigo-staging` Worker
`RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` (never paste it in chat/PRs), then re-run the failed
staging job of run `35815905652` (or the automatic run on the then-current
main) through the reviewed workflow. Merging this docs receipt moves main, so
the exact-main SHA must be re-certified before that new SHA is released. No
deployment, migration, secret change, rollout or rollback was performed.

# Current takeover receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_CODE_COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository ID `1368281478` is `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`. Application PR #53 merged
normally at `03005fcbc39ab3c964393d2091f726088a4be5d0`; exact-head PR CI
`35810551334` and exact-main CI `35810986000` both PASS (189 files / 4,367 tests).
Integration reviewed head is `dbf32547a07fbc767e044365866a2bdfc4264cd8`; the
original recovery branch remains immutable at `0a04209e512d19293ed56a19d3fd51eb29ffefcd`.

Rechecked after the external merge: main remains `03005fc` and preserves the
exact recovered checkpoint. PR #54 carries this documentation-only handoff;
the application must not be reconstructed or republished as another PR.
Production D1 certification is blocked: this workspace has no Cloudflare API
token and `pnpm wrangler whoami` reports unauthenticated. Earlier takeover
evidence recorded missing GitHub verification secrets. Current repository and
Environment secret/variable listings return HTTP 403, so their present contents
cannot be independently verified here; Worker-side presence remains unverified.
Automatic staging run `35811338820` failed BEFORE deployment on the missing
staging verification secret; its production job was skipped. No deployment,
migration, secret change, rollout or rollback was performed.

See `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T19_V2_TAKEOVER_AUDIT.md` for evidence and operator
steps. Provision the release prerequisites, certify production read-only, then
use the reviewed rollout workflow and prove rollback. T19 is NOT complete;
T20 remains blocked. Earlier pending/publication-blocked claims below are
historical and superseded by this receipt.

# Frigo / Takosan current authority — 2026-09-22

## T19 V2 — one recipe authority + 500-recipe D1 cutover (integration)

**Current: `T19_V2_APPLICATION_INTEGRATED_CI_PENDING`.** Stable repository ID
`1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako3/Frigo-dev`; canonical main/integration base
is `a3b1564`. The immutable original branch
`feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2` is published at `0a04209`, exactly the
expected safe-stop head, and application checkpoint `558be74` was cherry-picked
onto `feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2-integration` without replaying its
obsolete safe-stop documentation. PR #52 is merged historical documentation.

The integrated application makes Meal Planner use the same
`resolveRecipeAuthority` snapshot as Recipe API/Week/Shopping/Cooking,
authority-scopes catalog fingerprints, persists stored-plan authority identity,
reports typed `CATALOG_AUTHORITY_CHANGED` revalidation, accepts only reviewed
`static|shadow|canary{1,2,5,25}|d1` release states, and exposes protected
machine-verifiable authority evidence. Planner recipe content and steps come
from the authority snapshot in every mode; D1 supplies only fenced planner
enrichment under D1 authority. Current-tree verification: full Vitest **189
files / 4,364 tests PASS** (run A); the final rerun (run B) passed 4,363 with
one 5 s contention timeout in the unrelated T13 real-D1 file, which passed
22/22 in isolation; focused authority/planner/release/shopping/cooking/
inventory matrix 13 files / 356 PASS plus 23 snapshot/persistence tests after
the last cleanup; release-check 155, D1 certification 32 and Worker rollback 10
unit tests PASS; `pnpm lint`, both `pnpm typecheck` configs,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm recipe:import:check` (500 recipes,
`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`), `pnpm build` and `git diff --check` PASS. The
Wrangler-shaped `release-certify` fixture proves tip
`0037_recipe_catalog_scale.sql` with 500 recipes, clean foreign keys and
`quick_check=ok`.

Final hardening (two independent review passes): stored plans detect
same-source authority fingerprint drift; static planning reads no D1 rows and
hidden D1-only recipes/ingredients/families cannot alter its identity; the
protected route requires a real `Bearer` scheme; canary and shadow release
probes exercise D1 truthfully, so `shadow → canary-1` needs proven D1
readiness and the release fingerprint. Production Deploy certifies the
committed `wrangler.jsonc` binding, Cloudflare account + `frigo-db` identity,
the migration ledger, catalog identity (exact ordered IDs, zero duplicate
IDs/slugs, `runtime_order`), `foreign_key_check` and `quick_check` read-only
before mutation; requires the release ref to equal current main, rejects
backwards SHAs and stale/skipped/reverse promotions, requires explicit
rollback/bootstrap intent, proves the previous and deployed Worker versions
bind the pinned D1, and on failure or cancellation restores the exact previous
version through the Cloudflare API with a complete evidence proof. Staging is
fail-closed on `STAGING_URL`, `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` and the staging
Worker secret.

**Safe stop 2026-09-23.** The integration branch (application checkpoints
`8205883` + `553791a` plus the docs commit) is **publication-blocked**: the
repository's GitHub App credential cannot push workflow-changing commits
(`refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` without `workflows` permission`). Workflow
changes were not stripped and no partial branch was created. Workspace-only
recovery artifacts: `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.bundle` (complete
history) and `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.patch`, with SHA-256 values in
`.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.sha256`. The original
branch remains published and immutable at `0a04209`. Hosted application CI has
not run. Production is untouched: no D1 query/migration, secret/config change,
deploy, rollout or rollback. Next: publish with a workflows-capable credential,
open the application PR, obtain exact-head hosted CI/review, merge and certify
exact main before any production action. T20 remains blocked until
`T19_COMPLETE`.

## Google Safari profile recovery + registration-only Turnstile

Production base `8dc9198918837cb15f4a7ddf4f9029875b015091` was reproduced with
WebKit: a blocked first load of `accounts.google.com/gsi/client` left the
normal profile controlled by the Takosan service worker, while a clean/private
profile rendered Google GIS. The failing profile emitted
`FetchEvent.respondWith received an error: Returned response is null`; removing
the service worker/cache recovered the button immediately. The candidate fix on
`codex/google-safari-turnstile` makes the PWA fetch handler return before every
cross-origin request, so Google GIS and Cloudflare Turnstile are owned directly
by the browser. Same-origin cache misses now reject instead of resolving an
invalid null response.

Turnstile remains mandatory and fail-closed for account registration, including
the production configuration gate. It is no longer rendered or submitted for
login, forgot-password, or OTP resend. Those routes retain the shared auth rate
limit; resend keeps its 60-second email/purpose cooldown, and register/login
resend now no-ops truthfully for missing or already verified accounts instead of
mailing arbitrary recipients.

Validation: focused auth/PWA/browser-security **124 tests PASS**; full Vitest
**185 files / 4242 tests PASS**; lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production
build, and `git diff --check` PASS. A production-origin WebKit smoke against the
built candidate, with an active service worker and the first GIS request
blocked, recovered after the built-in retry: Google button visible at 362x44,
warning cleared, zero Turnstile frames on login, one on registration. The
unchanged dependency audit reports two moderate React Router advisories fixed
only in React Router 7.18+. No migration, secret, DNS, PayOS/payment, D1, KV,
R2, or queue mutation is part of this change. Detailed evidence:
[GOOGLE_SAFARI_TURNSTILE_RECOVERY.md](GOOGLE_SAFARI_TURNSTILE_RECOVERY.md).

## T18E — `T18E_OTP_TEST_RECIPIENT_REQUIRED`

Repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`; exact starting
main and production are `66627ffea890dad1cec4e31674449775a940c660`.
Branch `feat/t18e-otp-email-delivery-recovery` contains the provider router,
fail-closed auth, readiness semantics, and regression coverage. Production is
unchanged.

The production `SEND_EMAIL` binding is present, but current sender authority
and the exact failure category could not be read with the available Cloudflare
OAuth scopes. The operator-authorized production `RESEND_API_KEY` secret is now
present and authenticates successfully without its value being printed or
stored. The operator completed the DNS correction; Resend now reports
`tungjpstore.net`, DKIM, and both SPF-purpose records as verified. T18E does not
fabricate a primary root cause: current Workers Email sender authorization
remains UNKNOWN until an operator verifies the account or a sanitized
production event is captured.

Code now classifies and logs provider failures without recipient/OTP/body data,
falls through from Workers Email to Resend, distinguishes Resend quota/rate/
sender/recipient failures, invalidates production OTPs even after an unexpected
router exception, and reports readiness as `providerConfigured` separately from
`deliveryVerified=false`. Registration, resend recovery, reset
anti-enumeration, single use, expiry, cooldown, Turnstile, digest-only storage,
and production `devOtp` suppression remain intact. No Google file changed.

Focused auth/email coverage is **6 files / 165 tests PASS**; full Vitest is
**185 files / 4238 tests PASS**. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build pass.
The unchanged dependency audit baseline still reports 21 advisories / 6 high.
Review-only [PR #50](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/50) is OPEN;
publication head `eec404a` passed hosted validate run `35685553412` and was
`MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`. Final docs publication requires its own exact-head CI.
No migration, workflow, merge, staging, production deploy, or real email was
performed. The only production mutation was the explicitly authorized
`RESEND_API_KEY` secret upload; the operator separately completed Resend DNS
verification. Next: confirm Cloudflare sender authorization, supply an
authorized test inbox, and complete staging then separately authorized
production delivery verification. Full evidence:
[T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md](T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md).

## T18D — `T18D_READY_FOR_REVIEW`

Stable repository ID `1368281478` verified as `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`;
main/base `07ace57241f8270b2458610979c709bb69b9a65a`, CI #151 (`35584884792`) success,
Deploy #53 (`35585265322`) staging success / production skipped. Branch
`feat/t18d-a11y-human-style-hardening` was created from that exact base and
pushed; implementation freeze is `d3ef61c`. No business/server changes.

The four original human-style findings are fixed. Seven additional scoped P2
findings are also fixed; independent review open P0/P1/P2 = **0/0/0**. The
27-screen review is **14 PASS / 13 PASS_WITH_NOTE / 0 FAIL**. Two P3
observations remain deliberately deferred. Human-style semantic review,
keyboard interaction review, and accessibility-tree/ARIA review were performed;
VoiceOver and NVDA were not performed.

Final focused evidence is **14/14 PASS** in **42.8s**, with strict axe
violations **0**;
log: `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/focused.log`. Final
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm check:migrations`, and
`pnpm build` logs all pass; Vitest is **185 files / 4226 tests** in **333.25s**:
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/{lint,typecheck,test,check-migrations,build}.log`.
Fresh style/contrast reruns pass: **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified** and
**33/33**. Lint/typecheck also pass after the test-only settling correction.

The second full matrix was stopped at approximately case 158 after
`t17-a11y.e2e.ts` sampled scan-review entrance opacity and receipt enable-state
before settle; the error context is retained. The parent patched the test to
wait 350ms **after** async CTAs become enabled, matching the T18C settled-state
convention; no axe rule or design token changed. The settled matrix passed
**349 cases / 5 intentional skips / 0 failures** (354 total, 23.3m) with log
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled.log` and artifacts under
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled/`.

All **84 T18D cases PASS**; 162 canonical axe checks have **0 violations**.
The five skips are duplicate project instances of the breakpoint sweep,
which passes once in mobile-390. Axe contrast incomplete records are retained,
not silently treated as passes. Full breakdown/commands are in the T18D report.
[PR #49](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/49) is OPEN, review-only,
from this branch to unchanged `main`; publication checkpoint `fe1b5d4` matched
remote (6 ahead / 0 behind main, 0/0 vs upstream). Hosted `validate` initially
IN_PROGRESS in run `35677663372` at 01:57 UTC; no review threads then.
CI/review auto-fix enabled; auto-merge disabled. This receipt is doc-only.
Next: inspect settled CI/review feedback. Do not merge or deploy. Existing
`.hoplite/settings.json` modification remains preserved and excluded; T18D
changes are committed, but the overall worktree is therefore not clean.

## Previous T18C receipt (historical; PR #48 is now merged)

**Current: T18C_READY_FOR_REVIEW.** Local certification is complete on
application freeze `6f8f6f40bb2c47dacd33670ac7397b0528b469a8`. Repository ID
`1368281478` resolves to `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; existing branch
`feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` retains the correct upstream and
unchanged base `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32`.

- Approved ZIP checksum verified; **27/27 direct board/contract comparisons**,
  fresh at 360/390/430/768/1024/1440. Final dispositions: **2 PASS / 25
  PASS_WITH_DOCUMENTED_DIFFERENCE**; no blocked/failed screen or unresolved
  P0/P1/P2. Baseline and pre-fix evidence remain separate and unchanged.
- Browser manifest: **379 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 390 unique cases**,
  162 canonical + 449 regression screenshot files, zero strict axe violations
  and zero horizontal overflow. Three outer-command timeouts required five
  recovery passes; this was not one uninterrupted green runner exit.
- Serial final gates: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (**184 files /
  4222 PASS**, 554.62s), `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`,
  `node scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs` (39/0),
  `node scripts/t17/contrast-audit.mjs` (33/33), `git diff --check`, and
  `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Completed 08:23:33 UTC.
- Failure history retained: genuine Home 200%-text P2 fixed at the freeze,
  12/12 focused rerun, interrupted resource-contended CLI-timeout attempt,
  and exact five-case outer-timeout recovery. No coverage or timeout weakened.
- Protected auth/payment/domain/backend/schema/workflow/production boundaries
  remain intact. VoiceOver and NVDA **NOT PERFORMED**; axe incomplete records
  remain visible. No live-provider transaction or remote migration.
- Evidence/report: `T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md` and
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/EVIDENCE.md`; published checkpoint `321824d`.
  [PR #48](https://github.com/vn-tako/Frigo-dev/pull/48) is OPEN against `main`,
  auto-merge disabled, CI/review auto-fix enabled. Hosted `validate` **SUCCESS**
  on `289d80a`, run `35578662531`, completed 2026-09-21 08:40:02 UTC.
  Final readiness audit: no unresolved review threads, `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`,
  no introduced migration/configuration follow-up. Style (39/0), contrast
  (33/33), worktree/base diff checks and unchanged-source boundary checks PASS.
  This receipt changes documentation only. Next: owner merge permission after
  the latest-head CI remains green; do not merge automatically.
  No merge, deploy or T18D. Preserve uncommitted
  `.hoplite/settings.json` and extracted reference files as workspace state.

## Historical continuation checkpoints (superseded by the result above)

### Text-zoom follow-up — final browser gate found one P2

The complete 390-case run ended **378 passed / 11 intentional skips / 1
failed**: Home overflowed 46px at 1024px with 200% text zoom. The fixed
breakpoint grid kept two narrow columns after rem-scaled sidebar/text growth.
Home now uses wrapping, rem-based flex regions, preserving the wider primary
region at normal sizes. The original zoom gate and an added explicit Home
stacking assertion pass at all six widths: **12/12**. No gate was weakened.
The previous final artifacts will remain separate as `pre-zoom/`; regenerate
all six projects against isolated per-run in-memory Preview servers and rerun
all repository gates before final certification/PR.

### Final repository gates — PASS (application freeze `b024b0d`)

Fresh unfiltered `pnpm test`: **184 files / 4222 tests PASS** (818.46s).
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build` and
`git diff --check` PASS. Style audit: **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified**;
contrast: **33/33 PASS**, one informational border pair. The only post-freeze
maintenance is license trailing-whitespace normalization and its regeneration
script; all five font checksums remain unchanged. The final browser run and
fresh visual review remain in progress; no PR/merge/deploy yet.

### Keyboard closure / final-gate checkpoint

Strict T17 target-size follow-up: added existing `tap-target` bounds to new
native brand/title controls; no target assertion was relaxed. Focused
mobile-360 accessibility + gap + flag-off Week run: **14 passed / 1 intentional
boundary-project skip**. The failed full attempt is retained separately;
final clean gate/matrix regeneration restarts after this bounded correction.

Review follow-up: non-recipe legacy Week cards have no detail destination;
their new title buttons were removed rather than advertising a no-op. Existing
choose/change controls remain. Regression **2 red → 5/5 green**; flag-off
routed browser setup **1/1 PASS**. Independent re-review: no remaining P0/P1/P2.
The 384-case attempt and concurrent unit gate were intentionally interrupted
for this correction; a fresh **390-case** run (adds flag-off coverage) follows.

Inventory detail and recipe recommendations now expose native controls;
shopping exposes item-specific checkbox state; shell brand links are native.
Legacy Week card/setup controls retain their existing handlers and draft
contract with native, state-labelled buttons. Two focused pre-fix browser
failures became **12/12 PASS** across six widths. An added sibling-action test
initially failed because an API refetch reordered rows; fixing its locator to
the stable item ID passed (1/1). Router fixtures now mount real Links via
MemoryRouter instead of omitting the newly used export: **37/37 focused unit
tests PASS**, typecheck/targeted ESLint/diff-check PASS. No assertion was removed.
Final complete gates and the unfiltered **384-case** browser run are underway;
interrupted earlier runs are retained as non-final evidence.

### Source-led fix checkpoint

Direct comparison now covers all 27 identities using the approved boards and
their higher-priority written contracts. Localized fixes cover native recipe
links, discovery grid, 640px shell/fixed-action alignment, Landing/Home wide
composition, radio/group naming, Home empty-state heading, privacy sentence
layout, and payment status announcements without countdown chatter. No domain
authority changed. Targeted browser reruns: **43 passed / 5 intentional
project skips**, then **18 passed** (strict dialog axe, discovery/privacy),
then **1 passed** (639/640/767/1024 boundary). `pnpm typecheck` passed.
Exact logs are preserved in `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/fix-verification.zip`.
Final all-suite certification and screenshot matrix remain pending.

## T18C — final redesign certification — SAFE PAUSE (2026-09-21)

- Exact start gate passed at `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32`,
  repository `1368281478` / `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; clean tree, CI #145 green,
  Deploy #52 staging green and production skipped. No overlapping redesign PR.
- New branch: `feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification`. No merge/deployment.
- Approved Takosan OS boards/ZIP are unavailable: **DIRECT_BOARD_COMPARISON_PENDING**.
  Reconstructed requirements and older Frigo boards are not direct authority.
- Checkpoint A `ac4d90e` pushed with the 162-screenshot baseline archive.
  Baseline: route/overflow/nav 162/162; 15 moderate axe instances/viewport on
  11 identities. Evidence-led presentation fixes applied (landmarks, heading
  order, camera reduced-motion, VietQR dialog focus trap/return) with
  red/green targeted regressions; payment/OTP authority untouched.
- Style audit 39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified; contrast 33/33. Full Vitest
  183 files / 4217 PASS applies only to the `ac4d90e`-era tree, not the pause
  edits; final matrix/gate rerun is the next action.
- Next: rerun matrix + gates on the fixed tree, finalize
  [T18C certification](T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md) and the resume plan in
  [T18C WIP handoff](T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md). Historical results below remain
  unchanged and are not current T18C evidence.

## T18B — payment authority unification — `T18B_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- Final review P1 fix starts at verified local/remote `0926222` on the same
  branch/PR. Issued monthly 49000/annual 499000 offers survive later catalog
  changes; current-price callbacks for those old orders are rejected. Structural
  validation, expiry/terminal-state rejection and replay/grant fences remain.
  Focused **151/151** (65 server payment), with explicit catalog-change and
  corrupted-row coverage; full `pnpm test` **183 files / 4217 PASS** and browser
  **48/48** across six widths. Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff checks
  PASS. Final commands, fixture/HMR recovery and publication boundary are in
  the report; earlier checkpoint counts below are historical.
- Repository `1368281478` / `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; exact starting and currently
  verified main `13ff3f22082fc0601a81b90c96edded4741194ac`. Branch
  `feat/t18b-payment-authority`, review-only [PR #47](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/47)
  OPEN, auto-fix CI/review subscription enabled, auto-merge disabled.
- One Worker price table retains **49000 monthly / 499000 annual / VND**.
  It supplies metadata and new offers only. After issuance the persisted intent
  is the immutable amount/plan/currency/order/expiry authority; signed PayOS
  instructions, callbacks and displayed QR must match that offer, not today's
  catalog. Only a valid persisted paid intent grants entitlement. No commercial
  price/discount decision was made.
- Signed callbacks bind order/amount/currency/plan/reference; transactional
  pending-only grants are idempotent and insert missing subscriptions. Provider
  errors fail closed. Legacy shared-secret grants are retired (410 for
  `grantCode`), normal old activation calls remain non-granting compatibility.
- Client checkout/status and fresh `/me` entitlement are identity/generation
  fenced; billing's expected-owner-header exemption is removed. Local cache,
  redirects and modal closure cannot establish Plus. All T18A code preceding
  the legacy Plus endpoint is byte-identical to base.
- Checkpoints A `2aba91a`, B `c00ea9f`, C `1cef30b`, semantic-error fix
  `1aabd32562edc2c5c37b3db9d7d19e1938896084` pushed. Focused 121/121;
  browser six-width 48/48 plus error-state rerun 4/4; implementation full Vitest **183 files /
  4185 tests PASS**; lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build PASS. First full run's
  single style-token failure was corrected in source, with brand/checkout 38/38
  and the complete rerun green. Security review: remaining P0/P1/P2/P3 = 0.
- Merge-readiness follow-up: exact-head CI `35554499704` passed at `2d6ff5a`,
  no review threads. Fixed deployed CSP blocking VietQR (exact image origin in
  both policies), retired the obsolete grant-secret warning, and removed one
  trailing blank line. New regression failed before the CSP fix, then passed:
  104 focused tests and 48/48 browser tests under the real image policy.
  Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/full-diff whitespace and built-header
  parity PASS; exact commands/failures are in the report. New-head CI is checked
  separately on the PR before readiness, not inferred from the prior run.
- No migration (38 existing), Inventory Truth, OCR/AI, recipe/planner/Week,
  Wrangler binding, infrastructure or workflow changes. Application-config
  adjustments are only the QR CSP and retired payment warning. No real payment, merge, remote D1 or
  deployment. Baseline main CI #140 and staging Deploy #51 passed; production
  job skipped. T18B is not deployed.
- Managed isolated Preview is ready after removing a hard-coded run-script port
  override; actual metadata and missing-provider checkout were exercised. UI
  provider evidence is synthetic, not live payment certification.
- Next: owner review/merge permission once final-head CI is green; no local blocker.
  Provider channel/secrets and live callback delivery need separately authorized
  operator verification before any release. Exact audit, contract, failures,
  evidence and boundaries: [T18B report](T18B_PAYMENT_AUTHORITY_REPORT.md).

## T18A — auth resend expiry contract — `T18A_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- Repository ID `1368281478` currently resolves to `omin-jp/Frigo-dev` (supplied
  `omin-vn` path redirects). Exact main/base remains
  `51d0d3755d83b64185066228d98f44ab7bad5e3c`.
- Branch `feat/t18a-auth-resend-expiry-contract`; review-only PR
  [#46](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/46), OPEN, auto-fix CI/review
  subscription enabled. No merge or deployment performed.
- Pushed checkpoints: server `88096cb7fbea8e3b95f5627ff5a46e8c3d34b462`, client
  `47c3a3391e086caf2760b61ee4e2bfacd331cacf`, security fixtures
  `53f9fefdc9d935bb736a37cdcd9f5b0d0479685e`.
- One unchanged ten-minute server TTL now controls stored OTP expiry and
  registration/resend response metadata. Client uses only returned metadata,
  clears old expiry on malformed/failure/offline outcomes, and preserves T17B
  route lifecycle, credential-free context and nullable delivery truth.
- Forgot-password request/resend returns identical generic lifetime policy
  for known/unknown accounts, never proof of issuance or delivery. Its distinct
  UI/reset semantics are unchanged. Security review found no actionable issue.
- Final local evidence: auth/security 300/300 (server 86/86, client 83/83 in
  focused subsets), full Vitest 180 files/4117 tests, T17/T18A browser matrix
  42/42; lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build PASS. Exact commands and
  hosted CI publication receipt are in the report. Initial browser launch lacked its
  locked Chromium; repaired and rerun green. Initial full run hit the 600s
  shell budget; final full run passed with two workers and no test exclusions.
- Billing/payment UI/behavior, migrations, other Worker files, Inventory Truth,
  OCR/AI, planner and production config have zero diff. T18B remains separate.
- Next: final-head hosted CI and human review only. No local blockers. Exact commands,
  failures, Worker line-by-line explanation and evidence are in
  [T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md](T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md).
  T17B records below remain historical and unmodified.

## Current T17B — contract reconciliation `T17B_COMPLETE`; release pending (2026-09-20)

Branch `feat/t17b-contract-reconciliation` was created from exact `main`
`858759f771baccb85f5ed6fd8e06df2fc0bbb112` in repository id `1368281478`,
`omin-vn/Frigo-dev`. Application HEAD is
`0f358f2f8c9da35c2167489ad6fd63eae8ea8c47`; certification checkpoint is
`00594eba755c6895f9edb9d3076282cf42919c44`. Documentation follows.

- Screens 04–06 are route-driven and history/refresh safe. Screen 06 is the
  planning-goal screen: a native `primary-goal` radio group with the existing
  client values `today`/`week`/`both` plus a review of the server-stored
  fields. `primaryGoal` is client-only (draft + auth state, never sent to
  `/preferences`); after confirmed completion `week` routes to `/week/setup`,
  otherwise `/`. Household size is not clamped: stored `6..20` shows as "5+"
  and round-trips unchanged unless the user explicitly picks a size (explicit
  "5+" writes canonical `5`).
  Screen 05 has exactly seven visible cuisine choices and nine visible
  restriction choices, both including canonical `other`. Stored values outside
  those visible chips, including `italian` and `vegetarian`, survive review and
  completion; spicy level remains independent. Authenticated onboarding updates
  local auth state only after server confirmation. The preserved offline-guest
  session path intentionally skips the server write and completes locally.
- `/auth/verify` context is credential-free, tab-scoped, identity-bound,
  strict-shape/expiry validated, and cleared on route, identity, cancel, and
  success transitions. Delivery is nullable, resend expiry is unknown when the
  API supplies none, failed replacement delivery clears stale claims, leaving
  the route resets loading, and only the server validates OTPs or creates
  sessions.
- The 27-screen registry now requires every declared content marker. Its clean
  reviewer-verified contracts passed 18/18 across six viewports, including
  onboarding direct URLs, refresh, history, native selection state, and no
  `primary-goal`. Older reconstructed-kit language is historical only.
- Post-review fix `56fc01b` reran: focused onboarding/auth 87/87, full Vitest
  180 files/4094, registry 18/18, full T17 216 pass/6 skips/0 failed, lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, build, and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Certification-checkpoint validation: focused auth 102/102, final verify/onboarding 39/39, full
  Vitest 180 files/4087 tests, T13 60/60, clean six-width T17 216 pass/6
  intentional skips, automated accessibility 12/12 across six viewports, style
  residual 43/43 allowlisted/0 unjustified, and contrast 33/33. Lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, and build passed.
- Clean evidence is under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17-playwright/final-00594eb-clean/`; validation is under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-validation-00594eb/`. The tested package
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-final-visuals-00594eb.zip` contains 232 entries and
  180 PNGs, with a complete per-screenshot manifest; SHA-256 is
  `d6f6d4f032c0ac637ce5d1523ecc95b1411bc567538bca8d235a7131e6ad9d70`.
  The 390px OTP and all onboarding captures were visually inspected.
- Corrective documentation checks passed for whitespace, required markers,
  protected zero-diff boundaries, ZIP integrity, and all 180 JSON/TSV manifest
  records and hashes. An initial ad hoc validator used the wrong command-field
  name; the corrected `generatingCommand` check found no artifact defect.
- Managed Preview initially inherited an inferred `pnpm dev` run path and could
  not provide the isolated API; guest creation returned 500. The effective run
  path was restored to `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`, the tracked Preview
  settings were restored unchanged, and the final exact-head Preview was ready.
  Supported synthetic reset/login then verified screens 04–06 at 390x844: five
  household radios, 7 cuisine and 9 restriction checkboxes, independent review
  values, and Back/Forward preservation, with no page errors.
- Worker, protected payment, migration, production-infrastructure, and deployed
  production state are unchanged; T17B intentionally changes the documented
  frontend auth/onboarding behavior.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED AUTH-CONTRACT BLOCKER`: registration reports a
  10-minute OTP lifetime while resend supplies no fresh expiry.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED PAYMENT-AUTHORITY BLOCKER`: frontend/VietQR prices
  `599000`/`79000` differ from server payment-intent authority
  `499000`/`49000`. Their server/API and payment owners must resolve them in
  separately authorized work. No deployment occurred. Full evidence:
  `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.
- Status is `T17B_COMPLETE`; T17 remains `T17_PARTIAL` only
  because direct board comparison and a human screen-reader walkthrough are
  external and unexecuted.

**Publication/readiness:** replacement PR #45 was opened against exact base
`858759f771baccb85f5ed6fd8e06df2fc0bbb112` from corrective documentation
checkpoint `f901b028af655b419cd96c3a8e29c358de34e636`. At publication head
`1cacd0b08ab788d355cef5ab09d950df038938f8`, hosted validate run `35532565549`
passed and GitHub reported `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`; reviews, review comments,
conversation comments, and unresolved human feedback were empty. The final
local pass reran focused auth/onboarding/session tests 74/74, changed-file
ESLint, typecheck, ZIP integrity/hash, protected-boundary checks, and
`git diff --check` successfully. PR #45 is ready for the authorized user's merge
decision when the documentation-only readiness checkpoint retains green/CLEAN
exact-head provider status. Direct board comparison and NVDA/VoiceOver remain
pending; neither has a named assignee or tracking issue in this repository.
Deploy only through the authorized operator path; production remains untouched.

## Previous T17 — continuation 6: contract gaps closed and certified, status `T17_PARTIAL` (2026-09-19)

Branch `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2`, PR #44 (repository id `1368281478`, now
`tako-san1/Frigo-dev`). Final-HEAD evidence lives in
`docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`; this section is the summary.

- **Screen 03 is a real route.** `/auth/verify` is registered with the same
  session guard as `/auth`; the OTP state is derived from the route over the
  unchanged auth state machine (Turnstile, verify/resend bodies, DEC-012,
  private-session capture untouched). A tab-scoped, code-free verification
  context (`features/auth/verify-context.ts`) makes refresh/back safe; a direct
  load with no context renders an honest "no verification pending" state with
  real exits. 14 regression tests (`auth-verify-route.test.tsx`).
- **27 registered screens certified mechanically** per width
  (`tests/e2e/t17-ui/t17-registry.e2e.ts` + `screen-registry.ts`): route
  resolves, visible proof, nav rule, no overflow — on real seeded truth
  (onboarding via UI, planner plan generated, T13 scan evidence).
- **Semantic-token migration finished.** 991 codemod replacements + manual
  dark-context sites; zero raw palette classes outside the protected payment
  UI (43 sites, explicitly allowlisted with reason);
  `scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs` is enforced by `takosan-brand.test.tsx`.
  Two arbitrary hex values removed. Zero emerald / transition-all / animate-in.
- **WCAG-AA measured**: `scripts/t17/contrast-audit.mjs` 33/33 semantic pairs
  pass (kit `text-muted` darkened to `#6F6B64`; `warning-strong`/`danger-strong`
  added). axe-core over 25 surfaces + OTP flow: 0 serious/critical. Viewport
  zoom re-enabled (was `user-scalable=no`). One h1 per surface, 0 images
  without alt, all targets ≥ 44 px (measured). Shared `useModalFocus` +
  `BottomSheet` primitive give every sheet/dialog trap/Escape/focus-return.
- **Reduced motion certified** on auth, onboarding, sheet/dialog, cooking,
  planner and scan review (no running keyframes, no spatial transitions
  > 200 ms; decorative pulse/ping/bounce and `transition-tap` collapse under
  the media query).
- **Visual contract**: canonical loop now 25 surfaces incl. `scan-review`,
  `receipt-review`, `scan`, `notifications`, `household`, `otp-empty`; state
  matrix (loading/error/empty/offline/sheet/dialog/long Vietnamese/keyboard
  focus/mobile fixed action + keyboard viewport). Human review of the 1440/390
  captures fixed: canvas width cap, aligned fixed bars, Plus/cooking phone
  wrappers, cooking title truncation, UNKNOWN-expiry tone on Home, 44 px brand
  links, honest OTP subtitle.
- **Gates at final HEAD**: see the report's Verification table (lint, typecheck,
  vitest, migration smoke, build, T13 suite, six-width T17 matrix, residual
  greps, worker diff 0, payment boundary 0 lines from this continuation).
- **Remaining blockers for `T17_COMPLETE`**: (1) board comparison — the kit
  ZIP (boards + `screens/*.md` + `SCREEN_REGISTRY`) was not available in the
  sandbox, so captures were reviewed against in-repo contracts only; a holder
  of the ZIP must compare the preserved captures and diff
  `screen-registry.ts`; (2) an assistive-technology (screen reader)
  walkthrough — automated semantics are clean but the human pass is unexecuted.

## Previous T17 — continuation 4: full-diff review with 10 latent defects fixed (2026-09-19)

**Continuation 5 — release prep (same day).** Inspecting fresh screenshots
for the PR exposed a **P1**: Tailwind `semantic` colour keys were camelCase so
25 of 28 kebab-case `semantic-*` utilities used across the new UI compiled to
no CSS (empty sidebar CTA, missing text/action colours). Fixed in
`tailwind.config.js`; new unit guard fails on the old config. Gates after fix:
lint PASS, typecheck PASS, vitest **178/4047**, build PASS, T17 Playwright
390/768/1440 **51/51**. PR opened into `main` (see HANDOFF for number/CI).
Deployment remains operator-driven per `DEPLOYMENT.md`; no new migrations.

**Continuation 4b (same day) — second pass + first local T13 run.** Three more
defects fixed: `FoodPreferencesPage` no longer flips onboarding completion
client-side (uses `setOnboardingFromServer(auth.isOnboarded, draft)`); nav
indicator `layoutId` is per-nav so the hidden bottom bar/rail cannot hijack
the shared-layout animation; dev-OTP autofill is a real `<button>`. **T13
Playwright ran locally for the first time: 54/60 → 60/60** after (a) updating
the logout test's target from `/profile` to `/me` (T17 redirect) and (b)
fixing a *pre-existing* failure (confirmed on base `769d085`) where the
presentation test faked onboarding via `localStorage`, which migration 0038's
server-authoritative hydrate overwrites — the test now completes the real
onboarding flow. Full T17 matrix: 360 **16/16**; other five widths **82 pass /
2 by-design skips / 1 test-only `networkidle` stall**, fixed and re-verified
**12/12** at all six widths. Lint/typecheck PASS; harness consumers 27/27.
Worker/PayOS diff still zero. Status remains `T17_PARTIAL`.

A file-by-file review of the entire redesign diff (`769d085..HEAD`, 76 files)
found and fixed: two **tenancy** violations (new settings pages used unscoped
query keys; now `queryKeys.foodPreferences()`/`planningPreferences()` with
invalidate-after-write), two **honesty** gaps (offline planning save showed
success although the write was only queued — now an explicit pending-sync
state; offline planning read hung forever — now an honest unavailable state;
household badge claimed a server status — now session fact only), two
**IA/layout** regressions (TopBar never showed the settings gear on `/me` and
still navigated to legacy paths; `/scan/*` review workspaces were wrongly
immersive and ReceiptReview's CTA would collide with the restored nav), three
**accessibility** gaps in the new auth components and Switch primitive (label
association, OTP group/digit names, reveal-button name/state, autocomplete,
`aria-describedby`), a **motion** defect (Switch thumb `layout` on an absolute
child; now transform-driven and reduced-motion-governed) plus half-implemented
inventory row enter/exit, and the **fixed-action primitives** pinned under the
mobile nav. One test-only fix (screenshot spec `networkidle` stall). Gates
after fixes: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178/4046 PASS**,
migration smoke PASS, build PASS, focused UI/auth **65/65**, T17 Playwright
re-verified for the affected tests. Worker/PayOS diff still zero. Status
remains `T17_PARTIAL` (slate-palette migration, human screenshot review, T13
local run outstanding). Full table: `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.

Third checkpoint on `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2`: all 86 indiscriminate
`transition-all` utilities were replaced by a scoped `transition-tap` token
(enumerated properties; layout never transitions); the remaining per-screen
motion stories landed (cooking steps transition directionally via Slide,
inventory list animates add/remove keyed by stable server identity with
AnimatePresence/layout, scan crossfade verified reduced-motion-safe); the
state-class matrix gained bottom-sheet, honest offline-banner and 200% text
zoom tests. The zoom gate exposed real defects — rem-sized nav icons forced
flex min-content overflow, the Profile hub card and Home header refused to
truncate, RecipeCard/IngredientRow rows could not wrap, and the inventory
search input lacked `min-w-0` — all fixed and verified clean by probe at 390
and 360 (desktop and mobile emulation) and by the suite at all six widths.
Two test-code defects (case-sensitive offline regex; zoom measured before
layout settle) were fixed test-only and re-verified **12/12** at all widths.
Gates: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178 files / 4046 tests PASS**,
migration smoke PASS, build PASS; the full T17 matrix run passed everything
except those two test defects, which the targeted re-run proves green.
Remaining honest gaps for `T17_COMPLETE`: 856 `slate-*` neutral-palette sites
still on legacy pages (brand `takosan-*` aliases are kit-permitted), human
design review of the canonical screenshots, and a first local run of the T13
Playwright inventory suite. Worker/PayOS diff remains zero; `main` untouched.

## Previous T17 — continuation 3 (2026-09-19)

## Previous T17 — continuation 2 (2026-09-19)

Status `T17_PARTIAL` per the Takosan Redesign OS v2.0.0 kit. Branch
`feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2` from live main `769d08597563f816ef9c1dd9523fdafb687de3e2`
implements: the full semantic token layer (CSS `--semantic-*` + tailwind
`semantic-*`), the kit type/radius/elevation scales, `motion@13.4.0` with a
`MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` provider and token-driven motion
primitives, a shared primitives module, a responsive AppShell V2 (mobile bottom
nav / tablet rail / desktop sidebar, immersive-only nav hiding, real-link
navigation with `aria-current`), the settings/account IA split with four new
dedicated pages over real server contracts (`/me/preferences`,
`/me/household`, `/settings/planning`, `/settings/notifications`,
`/settings/privacy`, `/settings/app`) plus redirects, planner canonicalization
with param-preserving Week redirects while the feature flag stays the rollout
authority, onboarding step routes, removal of the fabricated household
invite/join/member/QR flows in favor of honest unavailable states, removal of
phone-width emulation across 20+ shell pages, and brand cleanup to zero
user-visible Frigo/emerald presentation. PayOS/payment grants received zero
application change: `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` is empty and the only
payment-file diff is 12/12 presentation-only lines in VietQRModal.

Verification executed after implementation: `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm typecheck`
PASS, `pnpm test` **178 files / 4046 tests PASS** (re-run after the
continuation), `pnpm check:migrations` PASS
(sqlite3 CLI installed into the session environment, as the repo setup script
does), `pnpm build` PASS, and the new isolated T17 Playwright suite
(`playwright.t17.config.ts`, `tests/e2e/t17-ui/`) passing at
mobile-390 / tablet-768 / desktop-1440. Baseline gates on main `769d085` passed
identically before edits. `main` untouched; no merge, deploy, D1, PayOS, or
production mutation. (The gaps listed when this paragraph was first written —
AuthPage decomposition, the 360/430/1024 matrix and canonical screenshots —
were closed by continuation 2 below; the current honest gap list lives at the
end of this section and in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.)

Continuation 2 (same day, same branch): the **AuthPage monolith was
decomposed** into `src/web/features/auth/*` (AuthShell/LoginMode/RegisterMode/
OtpMode/ForgotPasswordMode/GoogleAuthSection/AuthField) with the kit's
auth-state transition and byte-compatible security semantics — the four auth
suites pass **11/11**. All **no-op animation utilities** (`animate-in`,
`zoom-in-95`, `slide-in-from-*` — dead classes from an uninstalled plugin)
were retired across 15 files onto reduced-motion-safe utilities. The T17
visual suite now certifies **all six widths** (360/390/430/768/1024/1440) and
captured **17 canonical screenshots per certified width**; the 360 run exposed
and fixed a real `/shopping` horizontal overflow (`min-w-0` on the quick-add
controls). Final gates after continuation: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full
vitest **178/4046 PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS, T17 Playwright
**42/42 PASS** at certified widths (full matrix green). Remaining honest gaps:
per-screen `transition-all`/motion-primitive migration, semantic-token
migration of legacy-styled pages, partial state-class matrix, and human design
review of the screenshots. Worker/PayOS diff remains zero.

## Current T16 follow-up — PWA cache and Google recovery deployed (2026-09-19)

Production evidence showed `/auth` and `/sw.js` returning `CF-Cache-Status: HIT`,
while the deployed Service Worker still used the fixed `takosan-pwa-v2` cache.
The repository registered `/sw.js`, but `_headers` targeted the unused
`/service-worker.js` path. This allowed old HTML and the old worker to survive
releases and explains why affected devices kept the stale auth bundle. Google
GIS itself loaded and opened the real account popup in a clean Chromium profile;
the affected browser's unavailable state is therefore consistent with that
stale client/content-blocking boundary, not a credential-less fallback.

The deployed release injects the exact release SHA into `sw.js`, registers
the SHA-qualified worker with `updateViaCache: none`, checks for updates on load,
online and foreground, deletes only previous Takosan release caches, and
best-effort navigates already-open same-origin clients once when an older release
cache is replaced. The navigation starts only after cache cleanup and
`clients.claim()` because awaiting it inside activation can deadlock the new
document fetch. Network navigation refreshes the offline shell and cache writes remain
inside the fetch lifetime. `/auth` and `/sw.js` are `no-store`; hashed assets
explicitly remove the inherited header and remain one-year immutable. Google
GIS uses a numeric clamped button width and its retry script has explicit error
and referrer handling.

The protected deploy workflow builds with the immutable release SHA and, after
exact-SHA readiness convergence, verifies live `/auth`, `/sw.js`, a hashed asset,
and the SHA embedded in the worker. Local Wrangler reproduced the effective
headers exactly. A two-release Chromium exercise proved one document request on
clean install and exactly one best-effort document navigation on update, with the
old cache removed and the new controller/cache bound to the new SHA. Focused
tests passed **116/116**; full `pnpm test` passed **178 files / 4046 tests**;
lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production build, shell syntax and diff check
passed. The additional non-gate `pnpm audit --audit-level high` reported the
existing lockfile's 21 advisories (6 high) in development/deployment tooling
paths (`wrangler`/`miniflare` `undici`, `jsdom` `ws`, and direct build-time
`sharp`); this change does not modify dependencies or ship those packages in the
browser bundle, so remediation remains a separate dependency-upgrade task. No
migration, D1 write, PayOS/payment change, recipe-authority change or
production data mutation is included. PR #42 head
`54dd81b3ba260843ed39d625c8e0b7c2f4cef831` passed CI `35415335137` and merged
as main `6a016f185cae9c51ab5a1fc873a8a05a10a57edd`. Exact-main CI `35415536459`
and staging Deploy `35415763483` passed. Protected production Deploy
`35415843682` passed every gate and published Worker version
`2f228dc9-d97b-4eb1-8cff-9a0f2df3b51c`, preserving recipe authority
`shadow/0/false` and D1 ledger 38 / tip `0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`.

Independent production checks found readiness on the exact main SHA with
database/queue OK and only the existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
warning. `/auth` serves the current bundle with `no-store` (Cloudflare Assets
may still label the edge response `HIT`), `/sw.js` is `MISS` plus `no-store`,
the worker embeds the exact main SHA, and hashed assets are one-year immutable.
A clean Chromium profile loaded real GIS, opened the `accounts.google.com`
account chooser, and obtained the exact-SHA Service Worker controller with only
the matching Takosan cache. A deployment cannot force a
closed, suspended, or browser-blocked legacy tab to execute; reload/reopen or
navigation is the guaranteed recovery boundary, while this release adds future
load/online/foreground update checks.

## Current T15C-D — 1% production Canary safe stop (2026-09-19)

Canonical repository ID `1368281478` resolves to `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`; PR #38 and

`T15C_D_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_TEST_HOUSEHOLDS_UNAVAILABLE`. Production stays
`shadow / 0 / false`. Receipt:
`recipe-catalog/T15C_D_PRODUCTION_1PCT_CANARY_CERTIFICATION.md`.
Receipt PR #40 passed exact-head CI `35410893001`, merged as `763d7e904798dc513c60d4da5f876598570c12fb`, then passed exact-main CI `35411093064` and automatic staging Deploy `35411300235` on `static/0/false`; production was skipped and remained unchanged.

## Current T15C-C — authorized canary test cohort mechanism READY (dormant; production still shadow) — 2026-09-19

`RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT_ENABLED` + `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_INCLUDE`/`EXCLUDE` (Worker secrets holding SHA-256 digests of `recipe-catalog-test-cohort:<householdId>`) give operator-owned test households a deterministic server-side include/exclude override for the D1 canary; precedence exclude > include > `isRecipeCanaryTenant`. Parsed and evaluated only when mode=`canary` (plus cutover, switch exactly `true`, authenticated tenant); in static/shadow/d1 the variables are inert, so emergency rollback is the single change canary→shadow/static with no secret cleanup (review P1). An active cohort must name ≥1 include AND ≥1 exclude household (`TEST_COHORT_PAIR_REQUIRED`, review P2). Malformed, duplicate, overlapping, oversized, half-applied, or one-sided canary configuration is fatal in production readiness (`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT`) and serves static loudly at request time. Diagnostics gain only a bounded `assignmentReason`. Normal FNV bucketing is byte-for-byte unchanged. No migration; `deploy.yml`/wrangler/release manifest untouched and guard-tested to stay that way. Classification `T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_READY`; production remains `shadow / 0 / false`. Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT.md`.
## Current T15C — production Canary safe stop; authority still shadow (2026-09-18)

Fresh audit on canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e` passed every local gate (`pnpm test` 176 files / 4008 tests PASS). Public read-only production checks: readiness commit equals main, database ok, five `/api/v1/recipes` reads at 71 in deterministic order, legacy IDs 200, reviewed D1-only IDs 404; the latest production Deploy receipt (run 35404106102) records `recipeCatalogMode=shadow`, canary 0, cutover false on that exact SHA. No authorized operator-owned inside/outside 1% cohort and no Cloudflare credentials were available, so Canary was not dispatched and nothing in production changed. Classification `T15C_CANARY_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`; receipt `recipe-catalog/T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`.

## Current T16 follow-up — OTP sender fix and guest account gates ready for release (2026-09-19)

A production-bound Email Service diagnostic isolated the OTP failure to the
sender identity: Cloudflare rejected `no-reply@frigo.tungjpstore.net` with
`email sending not authorized for subdomain 'frigo.tungjpstore.net'`. The zone
apex `tungjpstore.net` is the domain currently onboarded for Email Service, and
the same remote binding accepted a harmless diagnostic from
`no-reply@tungjpstore.net` and returned a provider `messageId`. This proves the
request reached the email provider and removes D1, Turnstile and OTP generation
as the root cause for the observed registration failures. Actual inbox receipt
of a real OTP is still pending and must not be claimed yet.

Implementation commit `31006994849ee9f6d78ae6114f82d77d41efc784`
changes the transactional sender to the onboarded apex,
maps the provider's subdomain authorization message to the sanitized
`sender_not_verified` category, keeps resend available when the optional KV
cooldown store is unavailable, clears cooldown best-effort after failed sends,
and returns actionable `503 OTP_RESEND_UNAVAILABLE` for unexpected resend
failures. The OTP screen now waits for a fresh Turnstile token before resend and
recreates the widget after each consumed token.

Guest account boundaries are explicit. A guest may open `/auth`; `/plus`
replaces prices and payment UI with an account-required explanation and a link
to `/auth?mode=login&returnTo=%2Fplus`; the profile upgrade CTA points to the
same login flow. A successfully authenticated, already-onboarded account safely
returns to `/plus`. Authenticated users retain the existing Plus screen and no
PayOS, checkout, billing, webhook or settlement implementation changed.

Local verification is green: focused auth/email/account-gate suites passed **86
tests / 4 files**; full `pnpm test` passed **176 files / 4008 tests**; `pnpm
lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `pnpm
build`, and `git diff --check` passed. Real-browser checks at 390x844 and
1440x1000 confirmed the guest pricing/payment UI is absent, profile and Plus
CTAs route to auth, `returnTo=%2Fplus` is retained, and the auth page remains
available to a guest session.

This candidate is not yet merged or deployed. Production remains on Worker
`e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7` at main
`0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`, D1 ledger 38 / tip 0038, and
recipe authority `shadow/0/false`. No migration or production data write is
required. Next action: commit, exact-head CI, normal merge, exact-main CI,
protected production deploy preserving `shadow/0/false`, then verify a real
registration/resend or forgot-password email arrives without exposing its OTP.

## Current T16 — auth funnel and CSP hotfix deployed; OTP receipt pending (2026-09-19)

PR #34 merged the auth-funnel implementation commit
`3633a2fa8a0827a6aa31a3c86da7fb680a6e0f2a` and documentation commit
`66e8073161cf418ffe4df2ed6cece75d56087af1` to canonical main
`d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`. Exact-head PR CI run
`35385363064` and exact-main CI run `35385844667` succeeded. T16 now has one
entry funnel: landing offers guest or account, auth sends returning onboarded
accounts to the app and new accounts to three preference-only onboarding steps,
and onboarding contains no duplicate login/Google/Apple chooser.

Production D1 migration run `35386276549` succeeded and applied only
`0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`. The ledger is 38 / tip
`0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`; FK, quick check, aggregate drift, recipe
media and catalog certification passed. The recoverable Time Travel bookmark is
`000000d3-00000000-000050ea-709daab542439d8e8fab731b65dab714`.

Production Deploy run `35386532369` succeeded after the required Environment
approval. Worker version `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` serves exact
SHA `d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`; previous Worker
`c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1` remains the rollback reference. Recipe
authority stayed `shadow`, canary stayed `0`, and cutover stayed `false`.
`SEND_EMAIL` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` are present; `/api/v1/config` exposes the
expected client ID. Readiness reports the exact SHA with database, queue and
email configured; the only degradation is the existing
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`. `scripts/post-deploy-smoke.sh` passed.

OTP delivery now uses the structured Cloudflare Email Service binding with
Resend fallback and sanitized provider categories. Production registration and
resend return `OTP_DELIVERY_UNAVAILABLE` when no provider accepts the message,
and the undelivered challenge is invalidated. Google GIS and backend audience
verification now consume the same runtime `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` exposed by
`/config`; signed credentials remain mandatory.

Local release verification passed lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, full
Vitest **174 files / 4002 tests**, recipe seed/import checks, local D1 schema gate
through 0038, and diff check. Production Playwright at 390x844 and 1440x900
verified no horizontal overflow, Google GIS rendering, and a Google click opening
`accounts.google.com` without an origin error. The live guest path completed
landing -> guest session -> reload-safe three-step onboarding -> preferences ->
app; `PATCH /api/v1/preferences` returned 200 and the
`__Host-frigo_session` cookie remained `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`.

The production console exposed CSP blocks for Google Fonts, Google GSI styles,
and Cloudflare Web Analytics. Hotfix implementation
`79dfca6483d90fcf33380acfe33f880c1e6ff7a5` adds only the required explicit
origins in `src/worker/config/csp.ts` and `public/_headers`, plus unit coverage;
no wildcard or script `unsafe-inline` was added. PR #35 head
`c14a3755d95ddae316d5e6636ef85f9784ac4a54` passed CI `35388666150` and merged
normally as main `0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`; exact-main CI
`35388963509` passed.

Production hotfix Deploy `35389274233` passed the Environment gate, full local
gates, exact-head CI recheck, read-only D1 ledger/schema gate, Cloudflare deploy,
post-deploy smoke and exact-SHA convergence in one attempt. Worker version
`e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7` serves exact SHA
`0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`; previous Worker
`c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` is the immediate rollback reference.
The immutable manifest and live catalog confirm recipe authority remains
`shadow`, canary `0`, cutover `false`, and 71 user-facing recipes. D1 remains
ledger 38 / tip 0038; no migration was run for the CSP hotfix.

Independent production checks confirmed the exact SHA, expected Google client
ID, configured email service, database/queue OK, and only the pre-existing
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning. The live CSP header contains the
explicit Google Fonts/GSI/Cloudflare Insights origins. Playwright at 390x844 and
1440x900 found no horizontal overflow, loaded fonts, rendered one Google iframe,
and captured no CSP console violation. The Insights script was allowed by CSP
but its host returned `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` from the verification network.

Real OTP delivery remains unverified. `tungjpstore@gmail.com` already exists in
`auth_accounts`; both headless and headed automated Chrome displayed the real
Turnstile checkbox but could not produce a token, so no forgot-password request
was sent and no email receipt may be claimed. One legitimate production guest
test record was created and intentionally retained. No PayOS/payment, recipe
authority, Inventory Truth, or Week behavior changed.

## Current T15C-B — merged control plane; safe stop before production Canary (2026-09-18)

PR #32 was merged normally with the expected-head guard: certified head
`a7b3d23f2ad8b48203328116d0e35425390d2127` → main merge
`a6e81cd89b9e4c6b923cfc39947b01faf44ff5f3`. The PR head is an ancestor of main
with a zero-file tree delta. Exact-head PR CI `35344089103` was SUCCESS with zero
unresolved review threads; exact-main CI `35347246583` / job `105606601599` was
SUCCESS.

Automatic Deploy `35347579284` passed release and staging job `105607807690`,
skipped production job `105607809241`, and deployed staging SHA
`a6e81cd89b9e4c6b923cfc39947b01faf44ff5f3` on Worker
`12623f3b-ac64-4255-9fbf-c429b6225e1d`. Both release manifests certify
`static/0/false`; no automatic Canary leak occurred.

Read-only production recheck remains Shadow/static authority: Worker
`c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`, SHA
`88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`, five catalog responses at 71,
legacy IDs 200, reviewed D1-only IDs 404. Production D1 `frigo-db` remains
ledger 37 / tip `0037_recipe_catalog_scale.sql`, 500 recipes, 500 runtime
fields, and 500 media rows pending / 0 ready. Read-only SELECTs reported
`changes=0`, `rows_written=0`; a fresh aggregate catalog certification passed at
500 recipes / 2 approved batches / release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`. No migration
or production D1 write occurred.

No authorized operator-owned inside-1% or outside-1% production test cohort was
available in repository/env/operator inputs, and no customer household IDs were
inspected. Production Canary was not dispatched and no Environment approval was
requested. Durable evidence: `recipe-catalog/T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_SAFE_STOP.md`.
Classification: `T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`; next action is to
obtain both authorized cohorts, then resume at exactly 1% through the protected
workflow. Full D1, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS/auth remain
out of scope.

## Current T15C-A — bounded canary control-plane wiring in review (2026-09-18)

Certified base main is `6f589d0201499a3729d343e42ccb6d19fdff217a`, the normal
merge of PR #31 (`bb14ba3dcf594fdf4a71fa6bbd6e72fefa52e02e`). PR #29 was closed
without merge as superseded. Branch `codex/t15c-canary-control-plane` adds only
Deploy workflow policy, release-manifest validation/tests, and the T15C-A receipt
(`docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_A_CANARY_CONTROL_PLANE.md`).

Canary wiring PR #32 remains open and mergeable; its final docs checkpoint has
passed exact-head CI and is awaiting independent review. It must not be merged
or used to dispatch production canary from this task.

The release matrix is `static/0/false`, `shadow/0/false`, or
`canary/{1,2,5}/true`; `d1`, `full`, `full_d1`, arbitrary percentages, and
100% canary fail closed. Automatic `workflow_run` deploys remain static/0/false.
Mode, percent, and derived cutover are recorded in the immutable release
manifest and passed to both Wrangler jobs from validated release outputs.

Local focused tests pass (121/121), full suite passes (173 files / 3995 tests),
and seed/import/lint/typecheck/migration/build/diff gates pass. No runtime
canary code, migrations, production D1, Worker, media/R2, Inventory Truth,
PayOS/auth, or T14G changed. Production canary remains unauthorized and
unactivated; stop after opening the new PR and exact-head hosted CI review.

## Current T15B-SHADOW — production Shadow certified; safe stop before canary (2026-09-18)

Production Shadow certification is complete on canonical main `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c` in repository `1368281478` (`frigo-6/Frigo-dev`). PR #30 (`ad3e1d1656418aaf495b130443d6514926b8bdca`) merged with a zero-file tree delta; exact-main CI `35336548833` passed, automatic staging Deploy `35336830786` passed with STATIC71, and production Shadow Deploy `35337110268` passed release `105574386006` and production `105574426707` after the required Environment approval. Production now serves Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1` at exact SHA `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`; bounded convergence passed in one attempt / 574 ms.

Independent anonymous production checks prove `configured=shadow`, `selected/actual source=static`, five repeated `/api/v1/recipes` responses at 71, legacy `vn-canh-01` and `gl-12` HTTP 200, and five reviewed D1-only IDs HTTP 404. Cloudflare tail records sanitized Shadow comparisons with D1 500/500 hydrated, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, readiness `ready`, zero drift/order/hydration errors, `shadow_errors=0`, and no authority leak. Existing D1 migration receipt `35329772751` remains the only migration evidence: tip 0037, ledger 37, 500 recipes/runtime fields, 2/2 approved batches, FK `[]`, quick check `ok`; no migration or additional D1 write occurred.

Durable receipt: `recipe-catalog/T15B_SHADOW_CERTIFICATION.md`. Rollback remains available through the approved Deploy workflow with `recipe_catalog_mode=static`; previous Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052` is retained. PR #29 remains open/conflicting and was not merged. Canary, full D1, cutover, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS/auth changes remain out of scope. Classification: `T15B_SHADOW_COMPLETE`; stop before canary/full D1.

## Previous T15B-PRE checkpoint — STATIC certified; SHADOW wiring PR ready (superseded 2026-09-18)

Canonical main remained `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf` in repository `1368281478` (`frigo-6/Frigo-dev`); PR #29 stayed open and unmerged. Existing production D1 receipt run `35329772751` is SUCCESS and independently records ledger 37/tip `0037_recipe_catalog_scale.sql`, 500 recipes/runtime fields, approved batches `2/2`, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, FK `[]`, `quick_check=ok`, and 500 pending/0 ready media rows. No migration was dispatched again.

Static production Deploy run `35333517052` passed release `105563003928`, required production Environment approval, production `105563057055`, full gates, read-only schema gate, smoke, and exact-SHA convergence (attempt 1, 587 ms). Worker version changed from `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439` to `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052`, serving exact SHA `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf`. Five repeated live checks returned healthy database/config, static source, and 71 recipes; legacy IDs remained available and sampled Batch B IDs were absent. Full evidence: `recipe-catalog/T15B_PRE_STATIC_RECEIPT.md`.

Authority audit found no approved existing Shadow switch. PR #30 from `codex/t15b-shadow-wiring` contains only minimal reviewed workflow plumbing and guardrails for a `static|shadow` input; canary/full-D1 are not expressible. Local focused tests are 99/99; full gates are lint, typecheck, 173 files/3976 tests, migration smoke, build, and diff-check PASS. Implementation head `97aff50d…` exact CI run `35335079345` is SUCCESS; the final documentation head must also pass exact-head CI. Classification: `T15B_PRE_SHADOW_WIRING_PR_READY`; stop for independent review. No Shadow activation, canary, full D1, media/R2, T14G, Inventory Truth, PayOS, auth, force-push, or history rewrite.

## Current T15A — pre-production rollout hardening COMPLETE (production untouched)

T14F merged to main `9be395d0…`. T15A schema-gate hardening merged via PR #26 → main `70cf7e0d…` (`scripts/d1-schema-gate.mjs` derives required migrations from `migrations/`; `d1-migration-check.mjs` pinned chain + `catalog` certification).

Fixed forward-only in `8c6080aa…` (tests only — `tests/helpers/local-d1-worker.mjs` recycles workerd before the cache overflows; no migration/catalog/runtime change).

seed check, import check, `git diff --check` all PASS; focused growth suites 20/21 — the
`production forward path 0034 → 0035 → growth` test fails when both growth suites run together and passes
alone (root cause not diagnosed; suspect test isolation). Full gates (lint, build, full `pnpm test`, bundle
accounting) NOT run; Batch B (399) NOT started; no PR; no production action. Do NOT mark pilot certified
or start Batch B before fixing that test failure.

## T14E remediation — review P1/P2/P3 closed on the feature branch; PR #23 re-review pending (2026-09-17)

Forward commit on the T14E branch (old head `7b4edcc8…` kept). **P1 nutrition evidence** now survives end-to-end:
`NormalizedImportRecipe.nutritionEvidence` (macros + `evidence` + ADR-004 `sourceType`, default `imported`) → `normalized-recipes.json`
→ canonical batch projection → generated SQL persists one per-serving `nutrition_profiles` row `<recipe-id>_nutrition_v1`
(`source_reference` = evidence) linked via `recipe_nutrition` at version 1, alongside the legacy compatibility macros; compiler guard
`NUTRITION_EVIDENCE_LOST` + renderer invariant make macros-without-evidence impossible. **P2 immutable batch hash**:
`canonicalBatchProjection` (single function for compile/verify/composition/CLI) commits to schemaVersion, batchId, sourceType/
namespace/reference, license, usageNote and per recipe batchOrder/sourceKey/runtime/provenance/classifications/nutritionEvidence/
duplicateReview; license/usageNote/evidence/review-reason changes ⇒ new `batchHash` ⇒ new `releaseId` (runtime fingerprint unchanged);
row order/whitespace/key order irrelevant; mutated approved batch ⇒ `BATCH_COLLISION`; `verify` detects source metadata mutation.
**P3**: release-manifest load/parse failure is `status=error, code=RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID` (not `D1_READ_FAILED`). Current release
`rel-1a047444a3632771` (71/0, fingerprint `9ae153e6…`) unchanged. Scale with 50 % evidence-backed recipes: 500 ≈0.83 MB, 2,000 ≈3.3 MB,

`scripts/d1-migration-check.mjs` (17 unit tests). Fixes `scripts/d1-schema-gate.sql` to 5 `UNION ALL` branches — hosted D1

## T14D — Recipe Catalog Authority Cutover Architecture — development history (2026-09-16)

Base `d0856b48e043c72d1793002e7c6047a186ac890d`. Adds `packages/recipes/src/recipe-authority.ts`
(RecipeAuthoritySnapshot, StaticRecipeAuthority, D1RecipeAuthority reusing T14B-B hydration, SHA-256 catalog
fingerprint, strict readiness codes, FNV-1a canary bucketing) and `src/worker/services/recipe-authority.ts`

30 s/5 min bounded cache with singleflight, canary/d1 fallbacks, PII-free events + counters). Every runtime recipe
reader (`/recipes`, `/recipes/:id`, `/recommendations`, cook start/complete, week create/regenerate/swap, shopping
attribution, planner defaults) now uses ONE authority snapshot per operation; unknown runtime readers = 0 (guarded).
**No migration (tip stays 0035, no 0036). Production untouched: application `4ed98514…`, D1 tip 0034, recipe mode
static; T14C 0035 rollout still pending; nothing deployed.** ADR-026; design `recipe-catalog/T14D_RECIPE_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER.md`.

## T14C — Recipe Media Layer — development history (`feat/t14c-recipe-media-layer`, 2026-09-16)

Base `8d3ebc444bbaa577893dd88a9d21f308a24f0cf5` (T14C_CANONICAL_BASE_MAIN). Adds migration
`0035_recipe_media_layer.sql` (rendered by `renderRecipeMediaLayerSql`; `recipe_media` with closed
role/status/source vocabularies, `UNIQUE(recipe_id, role, version)`, partial-unique current-ready index,

D1-trusted key only, allow-listed MIME, immutable cache + ETag), additive `media.hero` on `/recipes`,
`/recipes/:id`, `/recommendations` attached AFTER filtering/ranking, and `src/web/lib/recipe-media.ts`
as the single frontend fallback point for all 7 image surfaces. 0034 is now pinned in the hash manifest.
Schema gate/migration smoke extended to 0035. ADR-025; design `recipe-catalog/T14C_RECIPE_MEDIA_LAYER.md`.
**Recipe authority remains `ALL_RECIPES`; no `d1` mode; production D1 stays at 0034; no production R2
write; no deployment; PR not merged (independent review required).** Media audit: 71 recipes, 45 unique
refs, 59 external (Unsplash, CSP-blocked), 12 same-origin (1 missing asset gl-11), 20 duplicate refs,
prompts 59/71. Status: see HANDOFF for the exact-head CI receipt.
**Independent-review remediation (same branch, forward commit):** `promoteRecipeMediaVersion` now takes the
R2 binding and verifies the object (exists, exact MIME, exact size, SHA-256 of actual bytes) before the
atomic D1 promotion; 0035 (still the only new migration, no 0036) now requires `content_length` for ready
and enforces the exact deterministic `storage_key` via `CASE mime_type`; `auditReadyRecipeMediaRecord`
reports `missing_content_length`. Production D1 remains 0034; nothing deployed; PR #17 not merged.

## T14B-B — COMPLETE: production D1 0034 applied, Worker deployed — 2026-09-16

Status `T14B_B_COMPLETE`. Production D1 `frigo-db` (`f975ec39-…`) ledger tip is now

`ab082dd4…343c`); certified 71/59/12 recipes, 385 ingredients, 341 steps, 71 runtime-field rows
(`runtime_order` 0..70 unique), 385 contiguous ingredient ordinals, `foreign_key_check=[]`,
`quick_check=ok`, remote schema gate PASS, zero drift in non-recipe aggregates.
GitHub environments `staging`/`production` now hold `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
(production has a required-reviewer gate); Deploy staging run 35101845374 SUCCESS, production run
35102115354 SUCCESS (owner-approved). Production Worker version `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439`
serves `4ed98514f65ddd3b3d83007cd726fd7c2e2136e6`; readiness reports `commit=4ed98514…`, recipes 71/59/12 in
static order, auth config 200, CORS preflight 204. Pre-existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
warning unchanged. Recipe authority remains static `ALL_RECIPES` (`RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE` unset; no `d1` mode).

## T14B-B — MERGED to canonical main 2026-09-16; production rollout blocked by existing OPS secret

Canonical main is now `c7455160bfc8d279d38bc7ca4c0751542012a3c5` (merge of PR #14 head `004e5a32…`
onto `c1c1c14a…`; normal merge commit; exact-head main `validate` SUCCESS run 35072991882; fresh
main gates green, 157 files / 3704 tests). Production D1 `frigo-db` has **not** yet received 0034 and
the production Worker still runs the pre-T14B-B lineage: the automatic Deploy (run 35073197948)
failed at the staging step because `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is not configured in the GitHub `staging`
environment (`T14B_B_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_BLOCKED_BY_EXISTING_OPS_SECRET`), and this session had no
Cloudflare credentials to apply the migration. Status `T14B_B_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`; T14C not started.
Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.

## T14B-B — D1 catalog parity, runtime view & shadow foundation — 2026-09-16 (merged; details)

Branch from exact canonical main `c1c1c14a2a7dccc883f1030d0dee7043754fb4a9` (repository
`vn-clo/Frigo-dev`, ID `1368281478`, protected). Migration
`0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql` (SHA-256 `23f35645…ada4d`, re-rendered in place during
review remediation — unmerged, no 0035) seeds the 12 static-only global recipes `gl-01..gl-12`
under their stable IDs/slugs and adds `recipe_runtime_fields` (canonical `runtime_order` 0..70
UNIQUE; `category` = typed **open** non-empty string; `region` = **closed** vocabulary
`bac|trung|nam|toan_quoc`; legacy nutrition compatibility macros) plus
`recipe_runtime_ingredient_order` (explicit 0-based ingredient ordinal, `UNIQUE(recipe_id,
position)`, 385 rows). Fresh local replay: `recipes=71`, `recipe_ingredients=385`,
`recipe_steps=341`, `recipe_runtime_fields=71`, `recipe_runtime_ingredient_order=385`,
`recipe_classifications=0`, `recipe_nutrition=0`; drift `staticOnly=[] d1Only=[]
orderDrift=0` and every core/requirement/unit/step/tag/media dimension `[]`; nutrition
`legacy_compatibility`; classification `typed_runtime_field`. Migrations `0001–0033` are
hash-identical to a fixed manifest pinned from `c1c1c14a…`.

Catalog order is behaviourally significant and persisted: `StaticRuntimeRecipeCatalog`
preserves `ALL_RECIPES` order, `D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog` reproduces it independently from
`runtime_order`, and behavioural parity (recommendation, tie-sensitive ranking, planner
generate/regenerate/tie, >5-alternative swap + executed swap, shadow health) is proved on the
**actual** D1 catalog output with no test-side reordering and reversed-catalog negative controls.

`hydrateRuntimeRecipes` (fail-closed) + `StaticRuntimeRecipeCatalog`/`D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog` +
`compareRuntimeCatalogs` give a D1 runtime view that is `toStrictEqual` to all 71 static
recipes; recommendation, planner generate/regenerate/swap and cooking (`gl-03`, `vn-canh-01`)
are proved identical on the hydrated view. **User-visible authority remains `ALL_RECIPES`.**
`RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE` = `static` (default) | `shadow` (off-response comparison, at most one per
isolate per `RECIPE_CATALOG_SHADOW_INTERVAL_MS`, PII-free diagnostic); no `d1` mode exists;
production config rejects non-static.
`SNAPSHOT_POLICY=IMMUTABLE_PAYLOAD_AUTHORITATIVE`; media `DEFERRED_TO_T14C`; cuisine taxonomy
deferred; Inventory Truth, Qwen, PayOS untouched; no production D1/deploy. Details and
evidence: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_D1_PARITY_SHADOW.md`, ADR-024. PR #14 open against `main`;
exact-head hosted `validate` recorded there.

## Current T14 integration refresh — 2026-09-15 UTC

Canonical repository: `vn-clo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`). Verified main before
this docs-only receipt: `a165474a623a8130c9a9ed4f1df096b3ac3b3ae9`; not the historical T14 audit base
`345cecf`. PR #9 merged as `911db7fdddcd60ea1e3f3c17b4aed3f4b922bda5`;
PR #10 is its docs-only rollout receipt. Recorded production Worker version
`20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` serves the custom domain at 100%.
Auth GIS popup, OCR pending UX and SPA/API COOP fixes are preserved. The old
`e6b9195` production baseline below is historical, not current release authority.

T14A audit knowledge is reconciled in
`recipe-catalog/T14A_PRODUCTION_RECIPE_TRUTH_AUDIT.md`; recipe architecture and
migrations were unchanged by PR #9/#10. Fresh frozen install, lint, typecheck,
test (151 files / 3633 tests), migration smoke, build and diff check passed;
all 33 migration hashes match. T14A merged through PR #11 after exact-head
`e916d292d391ba999bcdd96bfdfec98e6b598678` passed hosted run `35034318031`.
Accepted T14B-A source PR #8 is now **merged through PR #12** as `a165474a`.
Exact integration head `3e3937419b560f1ebf0aa7f5e29a3131508b7d94` passed hosted
run `35035112092` and all fresh local gates (154 files / 3676 tests). Its 15
functional paths are unchanged from the accepted source; recipe ADR-023 preserves
Auth ADR-022. All PR #9 files, 33 migration hashes and inventory authority match.
**T14B-B NOT STARTED**. Authority remains static `ALL_RECIPES` (71 = 59 VN +
12 global); D1 remains shadow, media is deferred to T14C, no 0034 is created.

Post-T14B-A main CI `35035415271` passed. Deploy `35035612637` has release success,
staging failure from missing `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, production skipped. This is
an OPS/RELEASE blocker, not T14. PR #4 remains open; **CLOSE_ARCHIVE** is the
recommended disposition, not merge. No deployment or production mutation here.
The RuntimeRecipe contract, completeness/FK-stub classifier, read-only D1 content
projection, drift audit and hardened seed renderer remain non-authoritative.
Fresh local replay: D1 complete 59, static-only `gl-01..gl-12`, d1-only/incomplete/
rejected empty, supported-field drift zero, nutrition `unsupported_by_catalog_model`.
Both integration prerequisites are complete (**READY_FOR_T14B_B**); no new task
is started. The receipt PR's post-merge comment records exact final main and
`T14B_B_BASE_MAIN` after this docs-only receipt, which cannot embed its own merge SHA.
Exact checks, status and next action: `recipe-catalog/T14_INTEGRATION_REFRESH.md`.

# Historical checkpoints — superseded as current-state and next-action authority

The original receipts below are retained, including their then-current SHAs,
test totals and “not started” statements. Use the refresh above for current truth.

## Auth/OCR production hardening checkpoint — 2026-09-16

Branch `codex/auth-ocr-production-fix` contains a focused production fix for
the auth/OCR issues observed on the live Takosan screen. The credential-less
`Đăng nhập nhanh với Google` fallback was removed; Google Identity Services now
waits for the async SDK, initializes once, and exposes an honest retry state if
the provider script is unavailable. The backend's strict Google credential and
audience checks were not changed.

Scan, fridge review and receipt review now share `ScanProcessingState`, showing
received/queued/analyzing/validating/review stages, elapsed time and a clear
promise that results appear only after server processing completes. Existing
`pending`/`processing`/`ready`/`confirmed`/`failed` contracts and polling remain
unchanged.

Verification on this branch: focused auth/OCR `54/54`; full Vitest `3632/3632`
across 151 files; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`,
`pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` passed. No production deployment, remote
migration, secret/configuration change, PayOS change or production resource
mutation was performed. Next action: browser smoke on the exact branch/PR,
then hosted CI and maintainer review before any release.

## Production rollout receipt — 2026-09-15

The previously blocked rolling-schema release was completed with explicit
operator authorization. Production D1 `frigo-db` now reports the complete
`0001`-`0033` ledger; `pnpm schema:check:remote` passed, including inventory
authority, scan evidence retention/completeness and foreign-key checks. The
pre-migration SQL export is `/tmp/frigo-prod-pre0032-20260916.sql` with SHA-256
`378c023b15c159d140162e6eb74bbf2ad584e7b699c72384379119defe6dec6a`.

Compatibility Worker `64ee9ed1d986a5e521598a36656e9c2f59d682ee` was deployed
first, then canonical Worker `e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` was
deployed to the production custom domain. Readiness now reports the exact
canonical SHA with `database=ok`, `queue=ok`, `ai=configured`,
`config.ok=true`; the only issue is the pre-existing warning
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`. Public health, recipes, manifest/Takosan
branding and unauthenticated mutation boundaries returned expected responses.

Remote SQL API ad-hoc `PRAGMA` queries returned Cloudflare `SQLITE_AUTH`; the
repository-owned remote schema gate is the accepted read-only evidence. No
production KV/R2/queue data was mutated, and no PayOS, DNS, secret rotation or
T14 work occurred. PR #4 (`release/pre0032-schema-compat`) remains open with
no hosted checks; it must be reviewed/merged before the compatibility code is
considered part of canonical `main`.

## Canonical repository consolidation

**CANONICAL REPOSITORY CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE.** The canonical repository is
`vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`), and `main` is
`a5cfb14cfd5840be23eb16b26a3689f5e2d6e805`. PR #2 merged reviewed head
`7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558` using a history-preserving merge
commit; its tree matches the reviewed head exactly. The immutable application
freeze remains `5f6853d0ed11415871dca0fd31d4981d60518310`; `e34ed167` is
historical and superseded.

Exact PR CI run `34972891435` and post-merge main CI run `34973522150` passed.
Branch protection requires strict `validate`, blocks force-push and deletion,
enforces admins, and retains the maintainer-authorized approval count of zero.
The rollback pointer preserves old main `d1b06732` at
`archive/pre-canonical-consolidation`.

## Maintainer review acceptance

`EXTERNAL_TECHNICAL_REVIEW=APPROVED` for final reviewed head
`7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558`, with P0=0, P1=0 and P2=0. The
maintainer explicitly accepts that review as sufficient for this repository
consolidation and may waive only the GitHub-native collaborator approval
requirement. CI, PR, force-push and branch-deletion protections remain active.

## Production deployment status

**ROLLOUT COMPLETE WITH FOLLOW-UP.** Production is serving canonical
`e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` and D1 is at migration `0033`.
The compatibility sequencing concern was handled by deploying `64ee9ed1`
before the bridge migration. The remaining follow-up is review/merge of PR #4;
do not down-migrate or bypass branch protection. PayOS, DNS, secret rotation,
production KV/R2/queue data and T14 remain untouched.

# Historical production integration evidence — 2026-09-15

## Historical merger-plan audit — superseded as current authority

**NOT READY TO MERGE OR DEPLOY.** A fresh two-repository/branch/migration audit
is recorded in `docs/integration/CANONICAL_REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`;
the separate production rollout risks remain in
`docs/integration/SAFE_PRODUCTION_MERGER_PLAN.md`. Production
`main` already contains adapted frontend upgrade lineage `d270cd4`/`57c88c5`
and platform hardening lineage `3f33d11`; historical tips `fafe1cc`, `2052932`
and `089c406` are not independent cherry-picks. The confirmed migration
collision remains production `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` versus dev
`0023_inventory_truth_foundation.sql`, resolved by immutable production
`0001`-`0023` plus byte-copied T08-T13 `0024`-`0033`.

Qwen task-runtime source `da41686` is 15 commits ahead of and not contained in
production `main`; it remains a required merge source. The fetched history's
additional `0024`-`0032` filename variants are the current integration branch's
`+1` aliases of the same certified dev blobs, not extra migrations.

New release blocker: canonical `0032_scan_evidence_retention.sql` enforces
`review_state`/`is_confirmed` coupling, while the current production Worker
writes only `is_confirmed`. The integrated Worker also assumes the new columns
exist. A schema-capability compatibility release and rolling-upgrade rehearsal
must precede any remote bridge migration. That compatibility release must be
merged/deployed independently, followed by separate Qwen/runtime, T08-T13
bridge, and Takosan brand-only trains; each begins at the prior deployed head.
Current `f26003b` is not production-deployable as-is; canonical repository
promotion still requires the exact lineage, docs-only and hosted-CI gates.
Repository access remains production
`ADMIN` and Frigo-dev `WRITE`. Promotion branch `canonical/5f6853d-promotion`
was published at `f48e830ed9cdde2214ad5b4dbd58b8bc30c06106`, archive pointer
`archive/pre-canonical-consolidation` preserves `d1b06732`, and PR #1 was
closed. PR #2 later completed the canonical merge; no production deploy or
remote database/resource mutation occurred.

Fresh planning-audit checks: repository/API metadata, heads/merge-base/ancestry,
source diff inventories, all-ref migration variants, bridge blob equality,
production/integrated scan SQL inspection, and two real SQLite ordering probes.
Both probes exited `1` with the expected trigger/missing-column failures.
Promotion validation then passed: frozen install, lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, build, `git diff --check`, full Vitest `3630/3630` (149 files), local D1
`92/92` (5 files), and browser `60/60` serial at 360/390/430. Hosted PR checks
have not started/reported yet; branch protection API remains 404.

## Historical remediation state — superseded by the merger-plan audit above

**INDEPENDENT-REVIEW BLOCKERS FIXED AND COMMITTED.** The working branch remains
`integration/t13-takosan-qwen`; remediation candidate is `5f6853d` on base HEAD
`231d1e7`.
The reviewed candidate `e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca` is
superseded and must not be merged as-is.

Protected payment UI is restored byte-identically to production base
`05423f2`; brand assertions exclude those protected surfaces. The Qwen scan
regression now exercises real router/runtime/provider composition and mocks only
synthetic DashScope HTTP before queue persistence and T13 confirmation.
Missing/0/.11/.9 confidence remains exact evidence; low confidence is retained
for review, while generic labels are rejected. Runtime escalation preserves a
concrete prior error when the next role is disabled. Certified T13 DEC-012 auth
deferral is intentionally retained and documented as an auth difference from
production.

Exact fresh checks: focused `41/41`; broader affected matrix initially `300/302`
because two brand assertions included payment, then brand `16/16`; full Vitest
`3630/3630` in 149 files; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, `git diff --check` PASS; browser `60/60`
at 360/390/430 PASS. No remote or production mutation occurred. Next action:
final review of immutable SHA `5f6853d`.
Two intermediate typecheck attempts exposed an over-generic then invalid
`fetch` spy annotation; `MockInstance<typeof globalThis.fetch>` fixed it and the
final typecheck plus focused `57/57` rerun passed.

Access preflight: `Tungjpstore` has production `ADMIN` and Frigo-dev `WRITE`;
repository IDs/default heads remain verified, with no branch protection or
rulesets reported. Local `origin` points to `Tungjpstore/yaji`, so it is not a
safe implicit publication target for this integration branch.

**HISTORICAL PRE-REVIEW CERTIFICATION — SUPERSEDED BY REMEDIATION ABOVE.** Branch `integration/t13-takosan-qwen` starts at verified
production `PRODUCTION_BASE=05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59` in
`Tungjpstore/Frigo` (ID `1360256196`). Normal common ancestor with certified
development is `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
`INTEGRATION_APPLICATION_CANDIDATE=e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca`.

The candidate combines governed Qwen source `da41686b`, certified T13 freeze
`32ddbb4` / review `9c3c3d3`, and hardened Takosan source `ff63edf`. Production
`0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` is byte-identical; ten certified T13
migrations are byte-copied at `0024`-`0033`. Pre-existing production migration
changes `0`; bridge mismatches `0`; 33 unique contiguous migrations. The real
queue path preserves missing/0/.11/.9 evidence, provenance and fingerprint into
T13 confirmation; replay creates no duplicate T09 effects. T09/T11 remain the
mutation/read authorities; unknown writers/readers `0/0`.

Historical candidate gates: frozen install, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, diff check
PASS; full Vitest `3628/3628` in 149 files; real local workerd/D1 `92/92` in five
files; browser last and serial `60/60` at 360/390/430. P3-1 and P3-2 remain
unchanged. **NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR INTEGRATION_APPLICATION_CANDIDATE**.
No deploy, main merge, remote D1/R2/KV/queue mutation, PayOS backend change,
secret/DNS change, or T14. Full packet: `docs/integration/`.

# Frigo current state — T13R certified, ready for independent review #2

## Current authoritative state — T13R certified freeze, 2026-09-14

**T13 REMEDIATION CERTIFIED — READY FOR INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW #2.** Repository
`vn-blo/Frigo-dev` (provider owner renamed from `vn-co3`), ID **1368281478**.
Branch `hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04` (this thread's broker-authorized branch; it

docs head). **T13R_APPLICATION_FREEZE=`32ddbb4f2bb636fdcf201e9ca99c4689d3655477`**,
published and fetch-verified. Protected main `d1b06732…` unchanged. Rejected

The freeze differs from the T13R-B candidate `7e68e3b` only by two certification
test/fixture commits (`bd2f5f3` fixture collision fix, `32ddbb4` new P2-B browser
reopen spec); `git diff 7e68e3b 32ddbb4 -- src packages migrations wrangler.jsonc
package.json pnpm-lock.yaml playwright.config.ts` is EMPTY. All T13R-A (P1-1..P1-4,

## Historical — T13R-A application checkpoint, 2026-09-13 (superseded)

**T13R-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13R-B. NOT a final T13 freeze.** Repository
`vn-co3/Frigo-dev` (renamed from `vn-co2`), ID **1368281478**. Branch
`hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`;
**T13R_A_APPLICATION_CHECKPOINT=`fc0f9c56c53ae7b17f2d1fb4770a6bc231ebc027`**.
Protected main `d1b06732…` unchanged. Rejected freeze `7b7bb69…` remains
**DO NOT RELEASE** and is the comparison baseline.

All six T13R-A findings are **FIXED** with permanent red→green regressions:
P1-1 async raw evidence (`scan-queue.ts`), P2-A complete raw mapping evidence and
P2-B reviewed-expiry round-trip (additive migration **0032**, sync+async writers,
DTO, both review pages), P1-2 canonical identity preserved under free-form rename
(`inventory.ts` PATCH), P1-3 lot-bound edit drafts (`IngredientDetailPage` keyed by
route + owner check), P1-4 receipt review requires `next.id === receiptScanId`
(`ReceiptReviewPage`). Migrations: **32**; 0001–0031 byte-identical; 0032 additive,
no backfill. Authority audit: inventory writer and T11 reader sets identical to the
freeze; UNKNOWN writers 0, UNKNOWN readers 0; no evidence column is stock authority.

Gates at checkpoint: lint/typecheck/build PASS; **3423/137** full Vitest;
**45/5** focused T13R-A; **92/5** real local D1 (workerd); **42/42** browser
(14 cases × 360/390/430); migration smoke with populated 0031→0032 upgrade; fresh
32-migration local D1 apply; legacy 0031→0032 populated upgrade on real local D1
(0 fabricated rows, FK 0); schema gate PASS. Details, commands and per-finding
tests: [T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md).

T13R-B blockers remain OPEN (Cloudflare fridge confidence fabrication, inventory
conflict/refetch UX, Home estimated-expiry qualifier, NULL opened-state truth).
No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation. `.hoplite/settings.json`
overlay remains uncommitted by rule.

## Historical — T13R-A safe stop, 2026-09-13T15:50:34Z (superseded)

**T13R-A SAFELY CHECKPOINTED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.** Repository
`vn-co2/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Independent audit `b9735b4` (docs-only,
FAIL verdict) is now remote on `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886` with verified local/remote
equality; protected main and all rejected-freeze lineage are unchanged. Remediation
branch `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership` starts at the
audit commit with an **empty non-doc delta** against the rejected freeze.

No remediation code exists yet: all six target findings (P1-1..P1-4, P2-A, P2-B)
are **NOT STARTED**; `NO_NEW_T13R_A_CODE_COMMIT=true`. Migrations remain 31 with
0031 untouched and no 0032. Cheap checks executed: `git diff --check` PASS; no
TypeScript/source file changed, so typecheck and scoped lint were correctly not
run. The pre-existing `.hoplite/settings.json` overlay stays uncommitted by rule.
Per-finding state, exact commands and resume point:
[T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md). Do not claim
T13 complete; next task is T13R-A implementation, then T13R-B blockers.

## Current authoritative state — independent T13 final review, 2026-09-13

**T13 INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW — FAIL.** The exact application freeze
`7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d` is not accepted for leaving T13.
Repository ID **1368281478** is verified; the provider now calls the same repo
`vn-co2/Frigo-dev`. Protected main and certified docs head remain unchanged.
Freeze → `4fcbc96b5a5d4b3cea2c2ad0bdb5682b1866891a` has an empty non-doc diff.

Fresh exact-freeze checks PASS: lint/typecheck/build, **3372/132** full,
**194/10** focused, **92/5** real local D1, **36/36** browser at 360/390/430,
migration smoke, all **31** fresh local migrations, legacy upgrade/replay,
local schema and diff checks. Detached status remains empty. Hosted checks and
legacy status contexts for the exact freeze are both absent.

Those gates miss confirmed blockers: **P0 0, P1 4, blocking P2 6**. Async queue
processing omits raw evidence and mishandles absent confidence; U7 can clear
canonical identity and submit a draft to another lot; receipt review accepts a
mismatched scan ID. Additional defects affect confidence, retained review fields,
confirmed expiry, conflict recovery, estimated-date labels and opening-state truth.
Independent local/browser counterexamples are retained; no application fix ran.

See [the independent report](release/T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md) for exact
findings, original AC1–AC14, roadmap closure, commands, failed/inconclusive probes,
and evidence. Earlier COMPLETE/all-PASS statements below are historical and
superseded, not current approval. Next: a new T13 remediation branch for confirmed
blockers, then a new freeze and independent review. No merge/deploy/remote D1/
PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation. This review changed documentation only.

## Current authoritative state — T13 detached certification, 2026-09-13

**T13 COMPLETE — STOP for INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW.** Repository
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Protected main remains
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
Continuation: `hoplite/mende-26679a14--browser-harness-final-cert`, started at
`3262eaff86333da142ada1135e5a20c58ea640eb` with application WIP fd32aa8.
Browser-proven U7 metadata correction was committed separately as
`47b10e25d6853a9bc4f9dfcf2e83bc01ba330bf2`.
**T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE=7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d** was
published, fetched and matched; subsequent changes are documentation only.

The repository-owned Playwright harness removes the Managed Preview dependency:
`pnpm test:browser` owns `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`, with synthetic
in-memory SQLite, blocked external application traffic and no remote bindings.
Pre-freeze and clean-detached browser **36/36** at 360/390/430; full baseline and
detached full suite both **3372/132 files**. Detached focused: T08 **130/2**,
T09 **1259/17**, T10 **98/6**, T11 **39/2**, T12 **22/3**, T13/T13B **271/12**;
current hardening/privacy/operator gate **194/10** (26 hardening, 26 actual CLI).
Fresh real local workerd/D1 **92/5**. Lint/typecheck/build/migration smoke/fresh
local D1 replay/legacy replay/schema/diff PASS; detached status **EMPTY**.
Writer/reader UNKNOWN **0/0**, **31 migrations**, 0031 unchanged/no 0032.
Original AC1–AC14 PASS; R3/R4/R5/R6/R7/R8/R11 and
U1/U4/U6/U7/U8/U12/U13/U14 DONE. P0/P1/blocking P2/unresolved scoped P3: 0.

Failure retained: concurrent detached browser initially passed 35/36 because the
full suite's existing source-writing generator triggered Vite reload during H.
The entire unchanged browser suite then passed 36/36 serially. Run source-writing
checks before browser certification, never alongside it in the same worktree.
HTML report credential leakage was fixed before freeze by removing that reporter
and adding actual lifecycle sanitization coverage. No freeze file changed afterward.
**NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE**; local gates are not hosted CI.

## Current authoritative state — fresh-session Preview safe-stop, 2026-09-13

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED.** Fresh-session public metadata
confirmed `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Trusted refs remain guarded main
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` and continuation
`hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification` at
`a9b5904aeba0fc7e4d649165770a4e86701312a2`; fresh branch `hoplite/mende-26679a14` started at the
same SHA with an empty status/diff. The required ancestry
`2334a6f -> c37a9b8 -> f845d04 -> fd32aa8 -> a9b5904` and the empty non-doc delta
from `fd32aa8` to `a9b5904` were reverified.

The effective isolated run is `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`; no settings,
scripts, application code, tests, or final T13 documents changed. Three schema-valid
managed-Preview attempts (`preview`, 120 seconds, promotion `preview:3000`) failed
before harness startup with: `Preview port must be a currently discovered HTTP
listener owned by the managed preview run`. Port 3000 is the harness default, but
no managed harness listener existed; `sandbox_ports` showed only browser processes.
No ad-hoc server or unsupported workaround was used.

Flows A–I and widths 360/390/430 are **NOT RUN**; real viewport-emulation capability
was not tested. No current focused/full/type/lint/build/D1/migration-replay/schema/authority
audit ran. Historical 176/9 and 26 hardening/adoption results remain historical only;
`CURRENT_FULL_TEST_COUNT` and `CURRENT_FULL_FILE_COUNT` are not established. No defect,
freeze, final docs head, merge, deploy, remote D1, PayOS, or T14 work is claimed.
Migration integrity passed: 31 tracked migrations, unchanged 0031, no 0032; replay is
not certified. `git diff --check` passed. The platform fault was reported and recorded.
Next: repair the supported managed Preview interface, then resume the mandatory WIP
browser flows before baseline, acceptance closure, freeze, and independent review.

## Current authoritative state — confirmed-review UX WIP, 2026-09-13 12:40 UTC

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED.** New continuation branch
`hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification` starts exactly at f845d04; prior
WIP branch and guarded main are unchanged. Repository ID 1368281478 and canonical
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`/historical redirect were freshly verified.
Published application WIP: `fd32aa8deaee7df454245591015780c59f909352` (not freeze).
Confirmed scans now show completed/read-only wording, hide manual addition and
replace the confirm CTA with `Xem tủ lạnh`; terminal remount/privacy guards remain.
PASS: **176 tests/9 files**, including **26 hardening** and **26 actual operator**
tests; typecheck, scoped lint, diff check. All 31 migrations unchanged/no 0032.
One fresh managed Preview attempt reproduced the mandatory-promotion platform
error; no existing isolated server was available. Reported again; stopped before
freeze per owner instruction. No browser/full-suite baseline/final certification
was fabricated. Required next baseline is the actual current runtime count, **not**
historical 3177/124. See the latest `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md`
section for exact checks and resume gates. No settings commit/merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

## Current authoritative state — T13B-B hardening WIP, 2026-09-13

**T13 NOT COMPLETE — browser/final certification blocked.** Current repository is
`vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**; historical `Tungjpstore/Frigo-dev` redirects to
that same ID. All guarded SHAs/ancestry passed; continuation starts exactly at
`2334a6f41cf68d42ae1eba7a30440b8fe324eb31`, never main.
Branch: `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-hardening`.
Published application-bearing **WIP**, not freeze:

Final focused **173/173 (9 files)**; T13B-A backend **1122/1122 (17 files)**;
typecheck, scoped lint, operator syntax and diff check PASS. Migration count 31,
0031 unchanged/no 0032; current-source writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0.
Managed Preview is blocked by its mandatory promotion schema; no browser/final

## Current authoritative state — T13B-B quota-safe WIP, 2026-09-13

Implementation stopped on the owner's instruction. The focused Part B preflight
completed **109/109 tests in 6 files**; full/frozen verification and final acceptance
are not complete. Initial 404/fetch failures were followed by successful broker
publication/fetch equality for WIP `a8cefd13505bc6b45dd11f45a6323539deb60f93`;
main was reverified unchanged. Fresh public numeric metadata still returns 404.
Actual branch base is `c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c`, not the
safe-stop expected documentation base `69b0dc676fcb4136861a8ca0c66994259eba5116`.
Read [T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md) for changed
files, executed checks, pending review, migration status and exact resumption steps.
No further implementation, main merge, deployment or remote D1 work is authorized.

## Current authoritative state — T13B-A backend checkpoint, 2026-09-13

**T13B-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13B-B.** This is backend-only continuation,
not final T13 certification. The older T13 completion claim below is historical.
Repository ID **1364064929**, current owner/name **vn-2l/frigo-dev**; branch
`hoplite/megara-hyblaia-888f1514`, exact base `3458c6cb971f5d96fce8eda3abc3d708437ce713`.
Main remains `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; no merge/rebase/deploy.

**T13B_A_CHECKPOINT=c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c** was committed,
published without force, fetched and verified equal to the remote branch.
Documentation follows separately; this is not a final application freeze.

Adopted receipts create one new T09 RECEIPT lot per accepted line, preserving old
manual/receipt lots and separate purchase facts, storage and expiry. Fridge SCAN
retains grouped CORRECT addition. Raw/confirmed correction evidence is validated
command intent in the existing receipt fingerprint and event metadata fingerprint;
`correctionOf()` is used in production. T10 rawName uses retained OCR, not the
reviewed name; absent raw stays null with a real subject identity. Concurrent and
post-commit response-loss attempts recover through scoped confirmed-status replay,
without repeating stock writes. Review/observation/command/status atomicity remains.

Executed: focused backend **1,122/1,122 (17 files)**; real local D1 **92/92
(5 files; 11 new)**; `pnpm typecheck`; scoped ESLint on all six changed code/test
files; `git diff --check`, scope/ancestry/migration checks — PASS. Four new regressions
fail on the exact pre-fix base as expected. Full commands, initial failures and fixes:
`inventory-truth/t13/T13B_A_HANDOFF.md`. In particular, the initial D1 race failure
(91/92) was fixed rather than weakening its both-success/exactly-once assertions.

Migration count **31**; 0001–0031 unchanged, no 0032. Focused writer UNKNOWN **0**,
canonical reader UNKNOWN **0**; T09/T11 authority unchanged. No frontend, protected
payment/auth, Week, setup or infrastructure change.

**NOT RUN — DEFERRED TO T13B-B FINAL VERIFICATION:** full application suite,
full lint/build, dedicated migration smoke/schema/upgrade gates, browser/mobile
checks, receipt/scan UX and adoption path, final T13 matrix/certification.
Next: continue from the published documentation HEAD with this exact application
checkpoint, following `T13B_A_HANDOFF.md` and DEC-016; do not start from main.

## Current authoritative state — T13 Receipt/Vision Truth & Inventory UX V2, 2026-09-13

**Verdict: T13 IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED on branch `hoplite/lindos-0368e413`; NOT merged to
main.** Repository ID 1364064929 (`vn-2i/frigo-dev`); `origin/main` still `d1b0673` (NOT
advanced). Base commit `578f705` (ROADMAP_AUDIT_HEAD). `T13_APPLICATION_FREEZE` =
`ad342703fb31a2b97d2798f1161fb83d4d0ed090`.

Scope closed: receipt/vision provenance truth (RECEIPT vs SCAN from server-side `scan_type`
only), purchase facts (real merchant/date/price or absent), truthful expiry kind
(KNOWN/ESTIMATED/UNKNOWN in distinct columns), raw-vs-confirmed OCR evidence retention,
T10 observation integration inside the existing atomic batch, additive read/decision routes,
and the Inventory UX V2 surfaces (lot detail + provenance, edit/MOVE, receipt review with
real confidence/price/date and per-line rejection, reconciliation page).

Migration `0031_scan_evidence_retention.sql` is additive only (adds `ocr_raw_name`,
`ocr_quantity`, `ocr_unit`, `ocr_confidence`, `review_state` to `scan_items` with
insert/update triggers coupling `review_state` and `is_confirmed`). Migrations 0001-0030
untouched. Fresh 0001→0031 replay and legacy-upgrade replay both PASS.

Authority unchanged: **exactly one inventory writer (T09)**. T13 adds exactly one new write
statement — a guarded INSERT into `inventory_observations` that rides the existing atomic
batch and writes evidence, not stock. Zero new writes to `inventory_lots`, `inventory_items`
or `inventory_events`; zero new `inventory_items` readers. Writer/reader audits UNKNOWN = 0.

Executed checks (clean detached worktree @ `ad34270`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`):
full suite **3,177/3,177 across 124 files**; real D1 **81/81**; lint, typecheck, build,
`check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `schema:check:local`, `git diff --check` all PASS;
`git status --porcelain` empty. Baseline before T13 was 3,092/120 and 70 real-D1.

Browser verification against the isolated preview (`scripts/security-preview.mjs`, in-memory
SQLite, `AI_MOCK_MODE`, external fetch disabled) found **7 defects that a fully green test
suite had not caught**, including a lot-id collision that made every line of one receipt
share a single lot id, and two identifier-bound errors that made every real receipt
observation permanently undecidable. All seven are fixed with permanent regression tests.

Main NOT merged; nothing deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched;
`MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED` and cutover flags unchanged.

## Current authoritative state — Roadmap reconciliation / gap audit of RC 64c5501, 2026-09-12

**Verdict: T13 REQUIRED** (receipt: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_ROADMAP_RECONCILIATION.md`;
scope definition only: `docs/ai/release/T13_PROPOSED_SCOPE.md`). Repository ID 1364064929

`hoplite/delphoi-499ad774` (requested logical name `hoplite/inventory-truth-roadmap-reconciliation`)
created at exact re-certification docs HEAD `1cae11e`; application tree = certified RC
`64c5501` (docs-only delta verified). Roadmap mismatch **CONFIRMED**: pre-implementation
sources `MASTER_CONTEXT.md@43718c2` and `tasks/T08-…@b5577ea` define T11 = "receipt/vision
truth and inventory UX V2"; implemented T11 = read authority (assigned to T12 by the T09
packet); T11 continuation handed the scope to T12; T12 never addressed it; no DEC/ADR
supersedes it. Matrix: Receipt/Vision R1–R12 = DONE 5 / PARTIAL 2 / MISSING 5; UX V2
U1–U17 = DONE 4 / PARTIAL 9 / MISSING 4; SUPERSEDED/OUT_OF_SCOPE 0. Release safety of
`64c5501` unchanged: P0/P1/P2 = 0; P3 notes — inferred shelf-life/day-chip expiry written
as `expiryKind:'KNOWN'` (DEC-003 conflict), Cloudflare provider fabricates defaults,
`FINAL_WRITER_MAP` scan row overstates changed-payload conflict, pre-existing outbox
head-of-line block on permanent 409. Actual receipt pipeline = pre-T08 legacy scan
draft → user confirm → T09 adapter with `sourceType:'SCAN'` (no `RECEIPT` lots, no
observation integration, price/date dropped, no reconciliation/lot/provenance UX,
`POST /inventory/adopt` has no product caller). Executed checks (clean worktree @ `64c5501`):
targeted vitest 55/55 (5 files) + a temporary uncommitted probe (4/4, deleted). Main NOT
merged; nothing deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched; no application change.

## Current authoritative state — Independent final re-certification of RC 64c5501, 2026-09-12

**Verdict: RELEASE CANDIDATE `64c5501ab0110658718b3752bd84e537f0854e12` TECHNICALLY

restored from main (blob `3818a00`, raw `48507643…`; overlay never committed).
D2 P2 documented: planner snapshot reader = `SAFE_DEFERRED` in the T11/T12 maps

## Current authoritative state — Final Release Integration Review (T08→T12), 2026-09-12

**Verdict: RELEASE CANDIDATE NOT READY** (docs: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md`,
`INVENTORY_TRUTH_ANCESTRY.md`, `INVENTORY_TRUTH_CHANGE_MANIFEST.md`). Reviewed from

Defects: **D3 P1** — web guests cannot finish email registration on the RC
(`AuthPage` always sends `migrateFromHouseholdId` for `hh_guest_*` sessions →
`409 INVENTORY_TRANSFER_DEFERRED` with no retry-without-transfer UI; reproduced by
curl and in the browser on the isolated preview); **D1 P2** — tracked
`.hoplite/settings.json` deleted from the RC tree by `4553b8a`; **D2 P2** —
flag-gated `/meal-planning` reader of `inventory_items` missing from the authority
maps (classified SAFE_DEFERRED). No P0. Main NOT merged; nothing deployed; remote

## Current authoritative state — T12 closed-loop runtime verification, 2026-09-12

**New T12 application freeze: `d15600186c3e73faba011eb690ac6cd70e8d3d2d`** — `fix(t12): complete
closed-loop runtime verification` — published/fetched (direct publication, no
PR tooling), local == remote == clean-checkout SHA; `22f675d` superseded.
Closed the independent-review gaps: P1 real workerd/D1 closed-loop suite (8

(`POST /week/plans/:id/shopping/complete`, `POST /recipes/:id/cook/complete`,
`GET /inventory`; 5 tests, stale KV injected), P2 reconciliation-vs-manual race
now requires the explicit `STALE_SNAPSHOT` loser (no `PERSISTENCE_FAILED`).
Route fix surfaced by the proof: adopted cook replays its durable receipt before
re-planning (response-loss retry → replay, not INSUFFICIENT_INVENTORY). Gates:
full 3,085/3,085 across 119 files; T09 654; T10 98; T11 39; T12 22; real D1

**T12 application freeze: `22f675d1cca76d05c93ebb2ed40bbaea11a72238`** — `feat(t12): close the inventory truth
loop` — the final Inventory Truth release-train task. The loop
evidence → observation → reconciliation → T09 command authority →
inventory_lots → T11 read authority → consumers is closed and proven by a
permanent 9-test closed-loop suite (E2E reconciliation exactly-once, DISMISS
inert, recipe/planner/shopping/cook/notification loops, single-winner races,

**New T11 application freeze: `c15c9a81fc4367b3506a7e2693798ebe1424b0a9`** — `fix(t11): complete read

Closed: real workerd/D1 proof of T11 (11 cases; real D1 51 → 62), adopted-but-

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation-t11-inventory-read-authority`
(start_branch successor; base = train merge `30ce4ea` containing exactly the
required T10 docs HEAD `c71692a`). **T11 application freeze: `657201f3a12f18dd96cc96adeac0dd1d3b75e6f4`**
published as **PR #3** (base `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72` — the release train,
NOT main); corrective `4553b8a` removed the platform auto-committed
workspace overlay (`c7e2296`; overlay preserved byte-for-byte uncommitted).
The T09/T10 truth layer is now the canonical READ authority: adopted
households read `inventory_lots` + validated mapping evidence through
`packages/db/src/inventory-read-authority.ts`; `inventory_items` never decides
truth; no dual-truth fallback; corruption fails closed; reads never write.
Read consumer audit: production UNKNOWN=0 (`docs/ai/inventory-truth/t11/

## Historical T10 state — observation claim fence (superseded by T11)

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation`. **New T10 application
freeze: `7393edcd4fb9cc8bb4df2a06628fb5dc57f8607b`** — `fix(t10): atomically fence competing reconciliation
decisions` — published/fetched, local == remote == clean-checkout SHA; `4c414fa` is
superseded (historical ancestor). Reproduced P1: two decision keys racing one OPEN
observation relied on a trigger side effect — the final guarded observation UPDATE with zero
rows is a silent D1 success, losers surfaced raw SQLite errors, and with the 0030 receipt
trigger absent both decisions committed. Fix: an in-batch `changes()` claim guard (T09
write-guard technique) makes a lost OPEN/vN → RECONCILED/vN+1 claim abort the whole atomic
batch (T09 commands, events, projection, receipt, observation all roll back); losers get
`OBSERVATION_VERSION_CONFLICT`; a committed same-key twin replays (response-loss preserved),
altered twin → `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. 13 regressions (13 fail pre-fix) + 2 real-D1 proofs
incl. a controlled race under workerd. Gates: full 3,024/3,024 across 114 files; T10

**New T10 application freeze: `4c414fa7eb33329ee12936c0899644af67e48f07`** — `fix(t10): compose multi-field
reconciliation commands atomically` — published/fetched, local == remote ==
clean-checkout SHA; the previous freeze `6c28858` is superseded (historical ancestor).
Reproduced P1: the planner collected per-dimension proposals independently, so one
lot could receive 2–3 CORRECT proposals (quantity/expiry/openedAt) plus a MOVE, mixed
claims took an expiry-only verdict, and split CORRECTs shared the `<decisionKey>#CORRECT`
client key (idempotency/CAS hazard). Fix: `composeProposals` merges all compatible
CORRECT changes into exactly one CORRECT plus at most one MOVE bound to the matched
lot/version (contradictions → CONFLICT `PROPOSAL_COMPOSITION_CONFLICT`); the decision
boundary independently enforces max one CORRECT / one MOVE / same lot+version / type
consistency and fails closed; CORRECT+MOVE composes through T09 `useCurrentLotVersion`
atomically. 19 permanent regressions (16 fail pre-fix). Gates: full 3,009/3,009 across
113 files; T10 focused 78/78; real local D1 49/49; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration

Branch `hoplite/himera-6d3eda84-t10-observation-reconciliation`, the platform-verified
successor created from the configured train base after PR #1 merged the frozen T09

`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` is untouched and NOT merged).
**T10 application freeze: `6c28858acd0627d2d602998107c2e260c5e4f0d5`** —
`feat(t10): add inventory observation reconciliation authority` — published/fetched
with local == remote == clean-checkout equality. T10 adds the observation/evidence/
reconciliation layer above T09 authority without any second stock writer: additive
`0030` observation/decision persistence (evidence never mutates inventory), a pure
deterministic planner (MATCH / NO_ACTION / STALE / AMBIGUOUS / CONFLICT /
PROPOSE_CORRECTION / PROPOSE_MOVE / PROPOSE_EXPIRY_UPDATE / UNSUPPORTED) with exact
milli quantities, name-matching refusal, contextual-unit refusal and confirmed-expiry
precedence, and a decision authority that composes existing T09 CORRECT/MOVE commands
in one atomic batch with receipt-backed response-loss replay and IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT
on altered semantics. Baseline before edits: 2,926/108 full, 44 real D1, all static
gates PASS. At the freeze: 2,990 full/112 files; T10 focused 1,097/19 files; real
local-D1 49/49; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration smoke/local schema gate (requires

## Historical T09 state — FEFO v2 backfill compatibility (superseded as current; freeze remains a verified ancestor)

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev` (live origin `vb-2f/frigo-dev`, same lineage), branch
`hoplite/himera-6d3eda84`, the platform-verified successor checked out at the exact
previous docs HEAD `8552fe5337245f2ac8349933c02946bf7d9dcc8f` (`hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72` tip unchanged there).
**New final T09 application freeze: `bf391c5fdcdd9e9c2f2257db515815e082cb4381`** — `fix(t09): support backfilled
mappings in fefo authority` — published/fetched with local/remote equality PASS.
The last remaining P1 is fixed: FEFO v2 now serves legitimate adopted/backfilled
synthetic lot mappings. Equal-ID authority was replaced, not bypassed: additive
`0029_inventory_fefo_backfill_compatibility.sql` recreates only the two v2 FEFO
triggers so a lot acts under its legacy projection identity only when LEGACY_BACKFILL
provenance, source identity and the immutable adoption receipt prove the mapping with
a preserved version offset; prestate parity accepts the exact kg/l display aliases;
poststate guards stay strict and native equal-ID lots pass unchanged. P1 reproduced
first (13/13 new tests fail DRIFT_DETECTED on the pre-fix tree, zero mutation).
Fresh PASS: 1,237 focused/15 files (59.52s); 2,926 full/108 (118.20s); 44 real
local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/29-migration smoke/local schema/diff. Clean detached
exact-remote-SHA checkout repeated every gate: 2,926/108 (119.10s), 44 D1, empty
git status. NO GITHUB CI STATUS for the branch. No route invokes v2 FEFO; the adopted
cook path already uses synthetic-compatible v1 commands. Verdict: **READY FOR FINAL
MAIN MERGE REVIEW** (main not merged by this agent). Exact evidence:
`inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical backfill compatibility state — superseded by bf391c5

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev`, branch `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72`.
Final backfill compatibility application freeze: **`df73bc035c2938b6fd082c57f6bca89a82d8e443`**.
The inherited backfilled PATCH P1 is reproduced and fixed without migrations:
synthetic lot IDs are authenticated by the immutable mapping and exact household
adoption witness. Projection CAS, event IDs, replay and composition retain both identities.
Fresh PASS: 619 focused/nine files; 2,910 full/107; 42 isolated real local-D1;
all lint/typecheck/build/migration/local-schema/diff gates. Exact fetched SHA also
passed frozen install, full 2,910/107, all gates and 42 D1 tests in a clean worktree.
**NOT READY FOR MAIN**: the bounded shared-caller check found v2 FEFO still rejects
synthetic mappings in unchanged 0027 SQL. Its fail-closed boundary is preserved;
further compatibility needs separately authorized schema work, not a guard bypass.
Exact evidence and next action: `inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical PATCH parity checkpoint — superseded by df73bc0

Repository `vn-2e/frigo-dev`, branch `hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72`.
New final application freeze: `e796f695bdb4228853992cdedc4e3cecf3437adb` (published/fetched equality).
External final review's storage replay and category parity defects were reproduced
and fixed. Complete normalized request presence/value is retained in native receipts;
CORRECT/MOVE/category commit atomically; historical response replay no longer reads
today's stock. Native commands without PATCH metadata are unchanged.
Fresh gates: 515 focused / six files, 2,865 full / 106 files, 40 isolated local-D1,
lint/typecheck/build/28-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS.
Recommendation: **NOT READY FOR MAIN**. An inherited P1 remains: PATCH of an
adopted backfilled legacy lot rejects its legitimate distinct mapping with
`500 DRIFT_DETECTED`. No adoption/migration fix was attempted in this narrow task.
Exact clean-source evidence, historical SHAs and next action:
`inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical evidence — all prior freeze/readiness claims below are superseded

## T09 F/G/H complete — 2026-09-11

Independent review follow-up `27427383d61930ea1b67ccbc1d69bb1cc069f931` is published on the same branch. It restores exact adopted PATCH response-loss replay before legacy version preflight, rejects altered key reuse, and retains normal CAS for a distinct key. Fresh full verification: 2,838 tests / 105 files PASS (165.25s), lint/typecheck/build and 28-migration smoke PASS.

T09F = COMPLETE, T09G = COMPLETE, T09H = COMPLETE (freeze + evidence). Application
freeze SHA: `9bf9ac0fe7b5e0d39615f39ae5cc30f84569af2f`, published/fetched on **hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72** with exact
local/remote equality; branch base `hoplite/kos-2a686759` is the platform read-only
configured base at `aa44d2a2f80ea33fd4b328aba906660c0129051e` and refused publication, so the verified successor
continues that exact lineage (same pattern as the prior transfer). A–E unchanged.
Full gates at this checkpoint: **2,837 tests / 105 files PASS** (155s), including the new 19-test adoption suite, 9-test G concurrency matrix and rewritten 14-test writer-fence suite; 38 isolated real local-D1 tests PASS; lint PASS; typecheck PASS; build PASS; 28-migration smoke PASS; local D1 schema gate PASS (0028 required).
Adoption: atomic receipt-backed `executeInventoryAdoption` (migration 0028), empty-household
activation evidence, executor-owned snapshot/authority validation, projection-compatibility
preflight. Every inventory writer now serves adopted households through the lot authority
(manual create/edit/discard, scan confirm, shopping import, cook) and fails closed with
`INVENTORY_AUTHORITY_REQUIRED` when mappings are incomplete; DEC-012 remains SAFE-DEFERRED.
G matrix: USE/USE, USE/DISCARD, USE/CORRECT, DISCARD/DISCARD, MOVE/MOVE, OPEN/OPEN,
FEFO/FEFO, receipt replay, duplicate event identity, household isolation, cross-tenant
identities, adoption races and stale-legacy-post-activation all pass with property sweeps.
Not authorized/started: main merge, deployment, remote D1, PayOS, T10. Independent
review readiness: READY FOR EXTERNAL ASTRA REVIEW (reviewer decides next steps).

## Historical continuation record — 2026-09-11 (superseded)

Latest verified/published application: `aa43e069edbff7843e9eb7532ff386b27be96a17`.
Same task, A–E COMPLETE; F IN_PROGRESS; G/H NOT_STARTED. F now has pure adoption
preparation, in-transaction legacy writer refusal for mapped households, scan/
shopping stock-revision fences, shopping claim/lease/response-loss recovery, and
server-scan confirmation recovery without duplicate manual additions. DEC-012 is
unchanged. No adoption activation or functional mapped-household adapters yet.
Fresh gates: **1,347 focused / 19 files**, **2,808 full / 103 files**, 38 actual
isolated local-D1 tests within those gates, lint/typecheck/27-migration smoke/build
and diff/protected-path checks PASS. Two scoped independent-review P2 findings
were fixed/retested; no remaining P1/P2 in this partial increment. Full F still
requires retained scan-intent validation, atomic adoption and all writer adapters.
Next: additive v3 atomic adoption authority, then functional adapters, G and H.
Detailed evidence/failures: `inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md`.

Canonical repository: **vn-2d/frigo-dev**. Writable successor:
**hoplite/kos-2a686759**, directly from verified interrupted F
`66858c5296b38715e4bfca77fca5eefe5adadf5a` on read-only prior continuation
`hoplite/orchemenos-e002591e`. Transfer/ancestry PASS; baseline 2,685 tests / 99
files, typecheck/lint/27-migration smoke/build PASS. At takeover: 18 ahead / 0
behind unchanged origin/main. Exact authority/evidence: `inventory-truth/t09/CONTINUATION.md`.
Earlier repository references are historical provenance only.

The following pre-transfer chronology is historical. Continuation was based on frozen T09D remote
811f7e8463303e010199741d66f88ab8a817212d. Successor documentation checkpoint
8bf32ed4e41ed3341215c6376e0c13ef13043616 was published/fetched before E code.
A–E complete; E published as `9bd1e6bc000cd2e94121469babb1a5eb63a5047f`.
Fetch/equality/ancestry PASS. F is in progress; G–H pending.
E adds deterministic 1–32-effect atomic FEFO, version-2 receipts/events and additive
0027; v1 authority and migrations 0023–0026 remain intact. No adoption, live writer,
HTTP or UI cutover. Latest post-fence gates: 1,172 focused / 11 files (35 actual
local D1 tests), 2,659 full / 98 files, lint/typecheck/build and migration smoke
PASS. Scoped independent E review has no remaining P1/P2 findings. Earlier
1,170 focused / 2,657 full results predate the ordered-receipt fence.
F first safety change implemented: DEC-012 guest transfers explicitly reject
before OTP/account/session or data mutation. Guest/auth/outbox focused 143 PASS;
full 2,685 / 99 files and lint/typecheck/build/27-migration smoke PASS. General
adoption and manual/scan/shopping/cook adapters remain next per
`inventory-truth/t09/F_ADOPTION_PLAN.md`. Full F completion is not claimed.
Exact chronology, limits and corrected failures: `inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md`.
See `inventory-truth/t09/CONTINUATION.md` for exact branch authority, checks,
publication restriction and preserved pre-existing settings overlay. All protected
surfaces untouched; no application freeze or independent-review readiness.

## Historical T09D checkpoint — 2026-09-10

Program: Inventory Truth Layer. Canonical repository: vn-2b/frigo-dev (user
confirmed). Branch: hoplite/euhesperides-d77023a5. Exact T08 base:
8f8788c1a0c9e486657751ef3875a5baa5334dec. Main anchor: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa.
Publication-first and A/B checkpoints published/fetched. T09C now implements
internal native command persistence with membership, CAS/revision fence, immutable
receipt/event and exact legacy projection; additive 0024 and actual local D1
rollback/executor tests. No HTTP exposure, historical adoption or old writer cutover.
Mixed legacy households fail closed with ADOPTION_REQUIRED. Full/native gates and
corrected findings are recorded in inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md.
Published C checkpoint 13133b3: 507 focused, 1,994 full / 93 files PASS;
lint/typecheck/build, 24-migration/local schema PASS; remote-source worktree 507 PASS.
T09D now validates retained receipt/event evidence, binds new events to declared
effects and actual written stock (additive 0025/0026), and rejects paired evidence
corruption. Final D gates: 1,031 focused / 2,518 full tests (95 files), lint,
typecheck, build, 26-migration replay/local schema PASS. D code checkpoint
b036b257a8ad775dd6f1a445dcfdcce38a6babf1 published/fetched with exact equality;
separate fetched-source worktree: 1,031 tests and typecheck PASS, clean tree.
Next: E FEFO and F legacy adoption/writer integration.
T09 remains IN_PROGRESS; no application freeze or independent-review readiness.
No main, legacy Frigo, production/staging, remote D1 or PayOS changes; no T10.
The release/T08 sections below are historical evidence, not current work authority.

## T08 COMPLETE — authorized publication (2026-09-10)

Repository `vn-2c/Frigo`. The user explicitly approved publication on
`hoplite/xanthos-7d942897` instead of the blocked original feature name (DEC-006).
That branch is now the canonical cross-account handoff; publish and fetch confirmed
`fb00f46d4633c9659e812be9f86119533973a8bd`, followed by this docs-only completion
receipt. Last code: `dd2ecc6f7066250dfdc5214a3d6c356e1479b61e`.
Base/final fetched main: `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`, unchanged.

Implemented additive 0023 storage/lot schema, strict quantity/money/expiry/source
contracts, guarded insert-only legacy backfill, compatibility projection/parity.
No legacy API/read/write path cutover. Fresh final-session **130 focused tests**,
**1,617 full tests / 89 files**, lint/typecheck/build, 23-migration replay/local
schema and diff checks PASS. Prior sandbox-local D1 apply passed 23/23. Early
failures and publication denial are resolved and preserved in the evidence log.
No source/test/schema change since dd2ecc6; later commits are documentation-only.

Next action: next account checks out `origin/hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`, reads the
handoff and final report, and waits for a separately authorized T09 task. No T09
implementation, main integration or deployment is implied by T08 completion.

Read `inventory-truth/MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `TASK_BOARD.md`,
`DECISIONS.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` and
`inventory-truth/T08_VERIFICATION.md` and `tasks/T08-inventory-truth-foundation.md`
for exact evidence, final Git anchors, limitations and T09 prerequisites.
Main, production/staging, remote D1, PayOS and release operations untouched.

## Authoritative source

- GitHub source of truth: main.
- Deployed application SHA: `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- Commits after the deployed application are documentation-only receipt merges;
  verify the current `main` head from GitHub when preparing a later release.
- Current `github-frigo/main` observed 2026-09-12: `db2377fd9f63d1be38ce3882c6d8173e0bf9e497`.
- GitHub API redirects `vn-2c/Frigo` to canonical public repository
  `Tungjpstore/Frigo`; the configured `github-frigo` remote remains the alias.
- OCR recovery branch: `codex/ocr-production-recovery`, based at `d8ca112a5ac5eb215f36a3f89b4218e2fc691371`;
  candidate implementation is committed at `ec87aec` and deployed through
  merge commit `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- The 2026-09-13 PR #17 merge added the OCR recovery implementation to `main`;
  production now reports the merge SHA and Worker version recorded below.
- PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA:
  `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
- PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD: `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.
- APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
- Verified application SHA: `0b20061e7dc7405df68b18a18da4166e09494ecd`.
- Verified release head: `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`.
- Main head before this correction: `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.
- The main merge tree is source-equivalent to the verified release head.
- Changes after the historical application base now include the merged OCR
  recovery implementation and its additive migration; the production receipt
  is anchored to `bdb0dda0…`.

## Verification snapshot

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Full suite | 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS |
| Focused T02-T07 | 819 tests / 40 files PASS |
| Clean D1 | 22 / 22 migrations PASS |
| Upgrade sanity | 0020 -> 0022 PASS |
| Existing data | 776 rows / 58 tables preserved |
| Browser | 264 assertions / 36 phases PASS |
| Payment-adjacent | 82 tests / 7 files PASS |
| Main CI | 34396319671 SUCCESS |
| Previous final-head CI | 34405307196 SUCCESS |

These are the preserved release gates; the post-cutover local gates and remote
schema/Week checks are recorded in the receipt below.

## Deployment and production boundary

- Previous release deploy workflow `34396457582`: **SUCCESS**.
- Previous docs-cleanup deploy workflow `34405457796`: **SUCCESS**.
- Release packaging completed.
- Staging was not provisioned; no staging deployment occurred.
- Production DB migration: **COMPLETE** - D1 `frigo-db` ledger contains exactly `0001` through `0023`; `0023` was applied additively on 2026-09-13 after the retained backup.
- Production deployment: **COMPLETE** - Worker deployed with Wrangler OAuth from candidate SHA `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
- Production reconciliation: **COMPLETE** - post-cutover source, schema, health and traffic checks passed.
- Active deployment: Cloudflare version `df7225c9-6f20-4206-9f16-573de6a69c43`, 100% traffic, deployed 2026-09-13T01:01:24Z.
- OCR recovery: **DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED**. Remote D1 `0023` is applied and gated;
  Qwen secret and non-PII smoke passed; readiness reports commit `bdb0dda0…`.
- Planner rollout: NOT STARTED.
- Production secret `QWEN_API_KEY` was added from the operator clipboard; its
  value is never stored in the repository or logs. Existing secret names include
  `JWT_SECRET`,
  `OTP_HASH_SECRET`, `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `QWEN_API_KEY` and optional
  `GROQ_API_KEY`. The Qwen key value is not written to the repository or logs.

## Production cutover receipt (2026-09-10)

Verified against `https://frigo.tungjpstore.net` after the cutover:

- Worker readiness: HTTP 200, `status=degraded`, `environment=production`, and
  full `commit=d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; database/queue/AI/email
  are `ok`/`configured`, rate limiting is `kv-best-effort`, and the only issue is
  the non-blocking warning `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`.
- Liveness and landing smoke: `GET /` and `GET /api/v1/health` returned HTTP 200;
  readiness smoke passed with database `ok` and no fatal configuration issue.
- Exact remote schema gate: PASS; migration ledger is exactly 22 entries
  (`0001`-`0022`), foreign-key violations are `0`, and the Week strict
  reconciliation is 2/2 plans with 0 orphan rows and 0 mismatches.
- Key preserved row counts: users 28, households 28, inventory items 13,
  recipes 59, meal plans 2, scan queue jobs 15, sessions 2, auth OTPs 0.
- CORS verification: the exact trusted origin receives its own ACAO header;
  path-bearing, localhost and arbitrary origins receive no ACAO header.
- Backup retained at `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-main-d1b0673-20260910T205627Z.sql`,
  mode 600, 521095 bytes, SHA-256
  `000c9cb88d6045afb19cca6ce3e1caa308b20ffa214dbb2cddfca0cb78d722eb`.
- Deployment used a clean detached checkout at the approved main SHA and
  `GIT_COMMIT` injection only; no planner flag, PayOS/payment path or secret
  value was changed.

## OCR production-recovery candidate (2026-09-12)

The candidate addresses provider/model recovery and scan failure handling without
changing the production receipt above:

- Candidate schema now includes additive migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`;
  local replay and schema checks cover `0001`-`0023`. Production D1 migration
  `0023` was applied after backup `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-ocr-20260913T005253Z.sql`
  (SHA-256 `bc62e5844c6a838a3b1b98d29dffa39c9d6cf6e1d570617e843c9e3e820bb088`).

- Qwen `qwen3.7-flash` is the primary provider for vision, receipt OCR, chat and
  recipe ranking through the DashScope international OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  (`QWEN_BASE_URL`, `QWEN_MODEL`); structured requests disable thinking. Groq is
  retained only as an explicit legacy fallback (`GROQ_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`),
  and is disabled in the candidate vars.
- Native Cloudflare vision remains opt-in through
  `CLOUDFLARE_VISION_FALLBACK=false`. DeepSeek remains the optional text/ranking
  fallback when `DEEPSEEK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`, and Z.ai/GLM the optional
  vision/text extension path when `GLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`; a GLM-5.3 Flash
  upgrade is future work and is not claimed as active.
- Vision and receipt responses pass Zod validation plus a deterministic quality
  gate: generic/placeholder labels and confidence below `0.6` are removed;
  no usable rows return `AI_SCAN_NO_USABLE_ITEMS` instead of a fabricated draft.
- Typed provider errors classify permanent `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, auth/permission,
  license, schema/invalid-response and quality failures separately from retryable
  `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `UPSTREAM_ERROR` errors;
  queue retries remain bounded by the existing attempt/DLQ contract.
- Scan status responses expose bounded error codes and retry metadata; OCR output
  remains untrusted draft data requiring review and confirmation.
- Focused local checks on 2026-09-13: Qwen provider ESLint PASS;
  provider/recovery, queue, quota, scan-route and UI tests PASS. The complete
  candidate `pnpm check` gate is green: 1,579 tests / 93 files PASS, lint,
  typecheck, migration replay through `0023` and production build all PASS.
- Live provider access is **VERIFIED**: non-PII chat smoke returned HTTP 200 from
  DashScope with model `qwen3.7-flash` and response `OK`. Production readiness
  returned HTTP 200 with `ai=configured`, database/queue `ok`, and only the
  existing non-blocking `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning.

## Verification commands

- `pnpm lint`: PASS.
- `pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `pnpm check:migrations`: PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`).
- `pnpm build`: PASS.
- `pnpm test`: 1,427/1,487 passed; 60 failures are confined to the two known
  shell/jsdom UI suites (`localStorage`/`container` unavailable). Hosted exact-SHA
  CI run `34413458369` remains the authoritative 1,487/87 PASS gate.
- `pnpm schema:check:remote`: PASS; `pnpm week:reconcile:remote -- --strict --json`: PASS.
- `pnpm audit --prod`: 2 moderate `react-router` advisories via
  `react-router-dom` (patched upstream at 7.18.0; major upgrade not included in
  this cutover). Full dependency audit reports 21 findings, with the remainder
  confined to development/tooling paths (`wrangler`/`miniflare`/`jsdom`).
- Read-only lineage checks: `git ls-remote --heads github-frigo main` returned
  `db2377fd9f63d1be38ce3882c6d8173e0bf9e497`; `git rev-list --left-right --count
  HEAD...github-frigo/main` returned `0 2`; no remote fetch or mutation was run.
- `git diff --check`: PASS for this documentation checkpoint.
- OCR candidate local lint/typecheck/test/build/migration checks: **PASS** on
  2026-09-13. Hosted PR #17 CI run `34728606704` also passed (1,579 tests / 93
  files). Live non-PII Qwen smoke, migration `0023`, deployment and readiness
  evidence are verified; only the non-blocking Plus Grant warning remains.
- Wrangler OAuth is authenticated as `tungbipdz@gmail.com` (account
  `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`).

Application integration and PR metadata are separate facts: application
integration is complete in main at `23ef51d`; PR #8 was already merged and was
not reopened, re-merged or modified.

## Kirrha archival state

Kirrha is two commits ahead of current main and differs in four `docs/ai/` files
only. There are no application differences on that historical branch that are
absent from main. Do not merge or revert kirrha.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

## Next task

Next task: MONITOR OCR QUALITY/LATENCY AND SCHEDULE REACT ROUTER UPGRADE

Keep the deployed Worker and planner flags at their safe defaults while the OCR
candidate is validated. Run the focused provider/queue/UI tests, all required
local gates and an authorized live-provider smoke against the exact candidate SHA;
then obtain hosted CI, readiness and canary evidence before any production deploy.
No remote migration or production secret change has been performed for this
candidate. Migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` is required before a
guarded deploy; do not touch PayOS/payment or use a down-migration. Until a new
readiness receipt exists, the production receipt remains the direct Wrangler
deployment above; rollback is code-only to a schema-compatible SHA.

The deployed receipt is anchored to main SHA
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`; the pre-cleanup main head is
`41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.

## OCR image payload optimization (2026-09-13)

- Local candidate `src/web/lib/private-image.ts` now decodes gallery images in
  memory, caps the longest side at 2,000 px, and emits JPEG quality `0.82` only
  when the derivative is smaller; small images are never upscaled.
- The original `File` is not modified or persisted. Private-session fencing and
  cancellation cover the async bitmap/canvas path; unsupported browsers fall
  back to the existing `FileReader` data URL flow.
- The attached 1,086x1,448 receipt measured 2,116,353 bytes as PNG. A local
  JPEG quality-0.82 conversion measured 382,334 bytes (81.9% reduction) without
  changing pixel dimensions. Provider OCR recall has not yet been re-run on the
  browser-generated derivative.
- Regression coverage: `tests/unit/scan-privacy.test.tsx` now has 11 passing
  tests, including resize, no-upscale and cancellation cases.
- Status: **COMMITTED LOCALLY / NOT DEPLOYED** at `ba3d872eea2d677e38f94adb8355f493c4c45852`.
  Next action is device/browser OCR smoke with the attached receipt, then open
  the release review for promotion.

## Qwen runtime governance candidate (2026-09-13)

- Working branch: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`.
- Base SHA: `05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59` (`github-frigo/main`).
  Canonical `main` is unchanged; no production deployment is authorized.
- Application checkpoint: `21c442d` (`feat(ai): add governed qwen task runtime`).
  Documentation remains a separate local checkpoint after this implementation.
- Added `QwenTaskRuntime`, model-role governance, versioned prompt registry,
  centralized pricing, bounded budgets/escalation, structured validation and
  isolate-safe usage telemetry. Production Worker composition now explicitly
  builds this path with `AI_QWEN_ONLY=true` and the role aliases in
  `wrangler.jsonc`.
- Scan HTTP, scan queue and meal explanation constructors share the same
  server-side AI config helper. Legacy non-Qwen adapters remain only for
  compatibility when Qwen-only mode is not selected; they are not constructed
  by the production path.
- Inventory boundary is intentionally limited to this repository: the final
  T08-T12 Inventory Truth AI-to-observation-to-reconciliation certification is
  pending later unification with `frigo-dev`; no code or migrations were
  imported from that lineage.
- Offline golden fixtures and `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` were added. No live
  Alibaba request is made by tests or CI. Optional shadow traffic is disabled
  by default and now reserves its call/token budget before launching.
- Final local verification: `pnpm check` PASS with 1,606 tests / 95 files,
  lint, typecheck, migration replay and production build all PASS. The check
  intentionally skipped remote D1 schema and Week parity because no release
  flag was supplied. `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` and `git diff --check` PASS.
- Focused recertification command covered Qwen runtime/provider, router,
  configuration, explanation, image privacy and scan queue paths: **119 tests /
  8 files PASS**. No concrete runtime defect was found during the final review;
  readiness already probes the additive scan columns from migration `0023`.
- `pnpm audit --prod` remains a known non-blocking follow-up: two moderate
  `react-router` advisories are fixed upstream at `>=7.18.0`; this task did not
  change dependencies.
- Candidate publication is complete: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router` was
  pushed normally to `github-frigo`, and `git ls-remote` verified the remote
  SHA against the local candidate. Canonical `main` remains unchanged at
  `05423f2`; no merge, remote migration or deployment occurred. Next action is
  code review or a separately authorized Qwen benchmark.

## Qwen pre-unification hardening (2026-09-13)

- Application implementation/publication SHA: `f8468eaa7d7fed3cbcf5ac7e780eca07ad3d71e4`.
- Final pre-documentation branch head (including the scheduler-failure
  regression test) is `a145ef5`; the docs checkpoint is a subsequent commit.
- The normal push was verified against `github-frigo/feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`
  at that SHA; this documentation checkpoint is a subsequent local commit.
- OCR capability metadata is centralized in `packages/ai/src/model-governance.ts`.
  `qwen-vl-ocr` is treated as a rolling alias (`pinned=false`), omits both
  provider `response_format` and `enable_thinking`, and continues application
  JSON parsing, normalization, Zod validation and quality gates. Supported
  Qwen multimodal models retain provider JSON mode.
- Singapore low-context estimates are now versioned as
  `estimate-2026-09-sg-low-context` for the fast/multimodal/OCR/reasoning tiers;
  judge remains an explicitly documented planning estimate. Cost telemetry is
  still estimated and reconstructable from model, token counts, cache counts and
  pricing version.
- Vision payloads are rejected before provider inference using decoded base64/data
  URL byte estimates. Defaults are 5 MiB for `AI_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` and
  `AI_MAX_OCR_IMAGE_BYTES`, bounded to 64 KiB-20 MiB; remote URLs remain unknown
  at this layer and rely on upstream storage/upload limits.
- Shadow canary remains `AI_SHADOW_CANARY_PERCENT=0` by default. When enabled,
  it reserves call/token budget and is scheduled only through the optional
  `backgroundExecutor` (`ExecutionContext.waitUntil` in HTTP routes); queue and
  other hosts without an executor skip shadow safely. Scheduler invocation
  failures are isolated so the primary response remains successful.
- Focused regression command: **134 tests / 8 files PASS**. Full `pnpm check`:
  **1,623 tests / 95 files PASS**, lint/typecheck/migration replay/build PASS.
  `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` and `git diff --check` PASS. `pnpm audit --prod`
  remains FAIL with the two pre-existing moderate React Router advisories
  (patched upstream at `>=7.18.0`); no dependency upgrade was made.
- No live Qwen benchmark, production deploy, remote migration, secret change,
  merge, or PayOS/payment change was performed. T08-T12 Inventory Truth work
  remains pending U01/U02 and is not imported here.
- Branch publication target remains `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`; verify
  the final commit SHA with `git ls-remote` after the normal push. Next action:
  code review, then a separately authorized benchmark/release decision.
Record the new post-merge main SHA in the final operator receipt; the
pre-cleanup main head is `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.

## SAFE STOP — T13R-B — 2026-09-13T21:35Z

Branch `hoplite/medma-164548ce`, WIP `7e68e3b` (P2-1 `4d587eb` below it).
T13R-B truthful presentation + conflict remediation code/tests complete and
green on executed checks (typecheck, t13r-b-presentation 12/12, full
Playwright 51 passed); certification and freeze not started. Details:
`docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13R_B_REMEDIATION.md`.
## Canonical promotion CLI checkpoint (2026-09-15)

- GitHub CLI identity: `Tungjpstore`; target `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (repository ID
  `1368281478`) is reachable with push access, but the account has no admin or
  maintain permission.
- PR #1 remains open from `canonical/5f6853d-promotion`. The promotion head was
  advanced by one empty commit, `ae1689c1f5525262da3478137b402692e4e4ed45`,
  solely to retrigger pull-request validation; its tree is unchanged.
- Exact hosted CI is still absent: no workflow run, check run, or status exists
  for the promotion head. Manual dispatch was rejected by GitHub with HTTP 422:
  `Actions has been disabled for this user`.
- No merge, deployment, remote migration, production KV/R2/D1 mutation, or
  payment/PayOS change was performed. Promotion remains blocked pending hosted
  CI and maintainer/admin authorization.
- Repository-owner authentication is now active in `gh` as `vn-dlo`, with
  admin/maintain access. `main` protection was enabled: PR required, one
  approving review, `validate` status required, force-push and deletion blocked.
- Promotion head is now `6ec7ff08ef258ef2ca95fb5d24b581b939ef1c92` after a
  second empty, tree-neutral CI trigger commit. Hosted CI still has no run.
- A clean owner-visible PR #2 is now at
  `8eb6d2b8d54e5e2fd08c0a11acd9f57a1e068b24`; exact hosted CI run
  `34968012294` passed validate, lint, typecheck, Vitest, migration smoke, and
  build. The PR remains blocked only by the required independent approval.

## Google GIS popup blank-page fix (2026-09-16)

- Root cause isolated from the production `/auth` response and Safari symptom:
  Hono `secureHeaders` was emitting `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`,
  which breaks the opener relationship Google Identity Services needs for its
  popup credential handshake.
- The Worker now disables Hono's fixed COOP value and applies a path-aware
  policy after routing: SPA documents use `same-origin-allow-popups`, while
  `/api/*` responses retain `same-origin` isolation. `public/_headers` matches
  the SPA policy for static hosting.
- Regression coverage in `tests/integration/worker-cors.test.mjs` proves both
  headers and prevents weakening API isolation. Focused auth/COOP tests pass
  (`17/17`); lint, typecheck and `git diff --check` also pass.
- Published through PR #9 after exact-head hosted CI passed. Worker version
  `20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` now serves 100% of the custom domain.
  Post-deploy smoke passed; `/auth` returns `same-origin-allow-popups`, API
  responses retain `same-origin`, and readiness reports database/queue/AI/email
  healthy with only the pre-existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`
  warning. No migration, secret, PayOS, DNS, KV, R2 or queue mutation occurred.
## T18C continuation — approved source recovered (2026-09-21)

Resumed `2e770f8e93bdda63dc3534093dc313d99fab229d` on the existing
`feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` branch. Repository ID `1368281478`
now resolves to owner-authorized `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; main remains `b8447e85`.
Upstream corrected to the matching origin branch. Pre-existing
`.hoplite/settings.json` is preserved and excluded from task commits.

`PORT=5173 pnpm exec playwright test -c playwright.t18c.config.ts
tests/e2e/t17-ui/t18c-matrix.e2e.ts`: **6 passed**, 162 screenshots,
162 strict axe audits with **zero violations**, zero overflow. This fresh
pause-tree result does not yet certify the upcoming source-led fixes.
The original ZIP is now available; see `T18C_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`.
Direct comparison is underway; desktop composition/breakpoint and keyboard
findings are being classified. Status: **T18C_PARTIAL**. Full T17 regression
and final gates remain pending. VoiceOver/NVDA NOT PERFORMED. No merge,
deployment, remote migration, or T18D work.

# T20 hardening — branch-local code freeze, 2026-09-26 UTC

**Not `T20_PRODUCTION_READY`.** `origin/main` is still PR #7 merge `bf57451`
(`bf57451e4a1a047eeff7a0938b903d1a37b6f8c9`); its last CI `36221190222` failed on the T20 add/remove race
test. PR #8 remains open at reviewed head `5b0a6b9` (`5b0a6b995786b338999286023eb2e46de4bc45a7`),
MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no unresolved threads, hosted `validate` `36226026618`
SUCCESS. Agents cannot merge PRs in this workspace. `pnpm check` on the exact
PR #8 head passed locally (201 files / 4,554 tests, migration smoke, build),
but **main has not gained that fix or an exact-main green CI run**.

The follow-up branch `fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine--hardening` / PR #9 is
stacked on PR #8. Checkpoints pushed: C2 `762015f` (revision recheck after the
torn plan/composition read and before Auto/Assisted apply option lookup; six
deterministic integration tests); C3 `bc92346` (invalidate picker results on
filter change), `c555443` (four-way filter/pagination assertions); additional
P2 fix `fb4416e` (Manual safety now uses T02 inventory before each added
component, including consumption by earlier components in the slot). No known
unfixed T20 P0/P1/P2 from this audit. Ownership, D1 revision fence, recipe
authority, V1/family shopping and composer budgets were not weakened.

At `fb4416e`, `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, 202 Vitest files / 4,562
tests, `migration-smoke=ok`, build. Focused T19/T20 authority, 500 catalog,
D1-only detail/cooking/shopping, and authority-change suites: 6 files / 80
tests PASS. The isolated T20-enabled preview was checked at 390×844, 768×1024,
1280×800 (Vietnamese/Korean/Japanese, combined filters, empty/clear, 20→40
load-more, keyboard focus/Escape, no horizontal overflow); production flags
remain off. PR #9 has no hosted checks while its base is PR #8's branch: CI
only triggers for pull requests targeting `main`/`master`.

Staging configuration exists, but local staging Cloudflare credentials are
absent and the GitHub App cannot read staging secret names (403). Target D1
identity, ledger and rollback bookmark have **not** been verified; 0039 has
not been remotely applied, and neither staging nor production was deployed.
Next: maintainer merges PR #8 normally, confirms exact-main CI, retargets
PR #9 to main, certifies its exact-head CI/review and merges normally. Then
verify staging identity/ledger with authorized credentials before a reviewed
migration and paired flag-off/flag-on deploy sequence. Do not touch production.

# T21R-B offline semantic snapshot preparation — 2026-10-01

Status: `T21RB_OFFLINE_TOOLING_READY`, not a production row classification.
Branch `codex/t21rb-offline-semantic-snapshot` builds on the separate T21R-A
certification commit `6bcef891` and has implementation checkpoint `5dd9990`.
`scripts/t21rb-v1-offline.mjs` recomposes the approved V1 release, checks the
committed release manifest/migration bytes and T21R-A target fingerprint, then
compares a saved five-statement catalog read using
`scripts/t21rb-v1-semantic.mjs`. It emits aggregate counts only and never calls
D1. Exact tuples retain duplicate multiplicity; a strict reviewed ID bridge
is identity evidence, not exact V1 runtime parity. Live physical positions
remain without authority. The design is in
`recipe-catalog/T21RB_OFFLINE_SEMANTIC_SNAPSHOT_DESIGN.md`.

Offline SQLite replay through 0038 supplied 500 recipes, 2,702 ingredient
lines and 2,064 steps; the CLI found 2,702 exact V1 ingredient tuples and no
unmatched lines. This is local replay evidence only. Focused comparator tests
8/8 and focused comparator plus staging Wrangler test 40/40 passed.
`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` passed typecheck/lint but failed one
unrelated staging Wrangler startup test at its 5-second timeout (4,897/4,898
Vitest); the focused rerun passed. A complete controlled rerun
`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2` passed 224
files / 4,898 tests. `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, syntax and diff
checks passed separately. The combined `pnpm check` is not claimed green.

Existing uploaded production receipts lack raw rows and cannot produce a V1
row classification. The five existing SELECTs are separate reads; a stable
ledger cannot prove an atomic snapshot. A future protected read needs exact
main CI, production Environment approval, account/D1 identity checks, content
stability assessment and a separate sanitized receipt review. No production
read, mutation, restore, migration, 0039 apply, flag change or deploy occurred.
`T21G_NOT_READY`; repair remains unauthorized.

---

# T21R-B protected V1 diagnostic integration — 2026-10-02 JST

Status: `T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_PREPARED`; no live V1 row result. On
`codex/t21rb-offline-semantic-snapshot`, implementation checkpoint `90569fa`
wires the existing offline V1 ingredient comparator into the manual, protected
Production D1 Read-Only Diagnostics workflow. The runner now observes the
five-statement catalog read twice, checks all three migration ledgers against
the reviewed 0038 prefix, binds the first read to the prior diagnostic and
order-coverage receipt, and emits `production-t21rb-v1.json` only after the
final exact-main check. Repository ID, production D1 ID, candidate SHA and V1
manifest hash are explicit guards. Raw rows remain runner-local; the uploaded
receipt contains allowlisted identity references, counts and flags, with no
row digests. Invalid
raw optional bits, contradictory comparison flags and coverage mismatch fail
closed.

This is `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC` evidence. The separate SELECTs do not prove
an atomic snapshot. The comparison certifies neither steps/metadata/nutrition
nor physical line IDs or runtime positions. A V1 ingredient match is not a
release certification or repair instruction. T21G remains `T21G_NOT_READY`;
repair, 0039 and production deploy remain stopped.

Verification: focused Vitest 3 files / 23 tests PASS; `pnpm lint` PASS;
`pnpm typecheck` PASS; `pnpm check:migrations` PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`);
`pnpm build` PASS; `node --check` on both changed scripts PASS. A full
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2` completed 225 files / 4,906 tests PASS;
a second run on the frozen implementation checkpoint also passed the same
225 files and 4,906 tests. `git diff --check` PASS. An exploratory `node --test` invocation
failed because these are Vitest files; the corrected Vitest command passed.
An initial receipt fixture had a diagnostic database shape mismatch and was
corrected before the final focused run.

No production SQL, read dispatch, mutation, restore, migration, 0039 apply,
flag change or deploy occurred. The next action is independent review, exact
main CI after a protected merge, and a separately authorized production
Environment read-only dispatch. Review only the sanitized receipt before any
row-level evidence path or T21G design decision.

---

# T21R-B protected integration merge — 2026-10-02 JST

PR #33 merged reviewed head `0b28b48e2fbd8f4892ddbf57ae9139d96addc0a3`
into protected main as `483e054b8ad5e0391aaedfcaf65343ce95949562`.
Exact-head CI `36931130799` and exact-main CI `36931887016` both passed
`validate` (lint, typecheck, Vitest, local migration smoke, build). The manual
read-only V1 diagnostic integration is now on main; no production diagnostic
was dispatched. Full authority, CI and safety evidence is in
`recipe-catalog/T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.

Current status: `T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_MERGED`, with no live V1-relative
production counts. The two SELECT observations remain non-atomic evidence;
receipt scope is recipe ID set and V1 ingredient tuples only. T21G remains
`T21G_NOT_READY`, repair unauthorized, 0039 stopped and production deploy
stopped. Next: separately authorize a manual production Environment read-only
diagnostic at an exact current-main SHA, then inspect only the sanitized
receipt before planning any row-level evidence path.

## 2026-10-12 payOS production recovery and Plus shell consistency

Scope: explicit owner authorization to finish payOS production integration and fix
related failures, including the reported home/Plus navigation mismatch.

- Verified active production is safe rollback source 4fb7c40, checkout OFF; staging
  serves 186a9cf with checkout ON. Existing channel secrets and webhook registration
  remain provisioned separately; no bank transfer or fabricated settlement.
- Corrected durable admission to accept the same bounded ASCII alphanumeric virtual
  bank accounts as the signed payOS adapter; real-SQLite create/replay/resume regression.
- Candidate download follows immutable artifact ID from the producer, including
  failed-only reruns; missing IDs fail closed, no name/attempt guessing.
- Added bounded recovery only for proven Wrangler 4.149.0 GET service/secrets
  metadata transient failures before any mutation. Every restart rechecks current
  main, exact-SHA hosted CI and release policy. Ambiguous upload/timeout stays failed
  and uses the existing verified rollback path. Only sanitized evidence is retained.
- Public smoke proves both ordinary and revalidated native-curl /sw.js profiles,
  three consecutive full SHA and matching byte hashes. Only a structurally valid
  prior canonical SHA waits, within 90 seconds; invalid assets still fail closed.
- Source cause of UI mismatch: /plus omitted from AppLayout kitchen allowlist; same
  defect exists in both current main and rollback code. Migrated guest/account Plus
  to shared header, top scan and five-item navigation. Regression enumerates every
  actual route; immersive scan/cook stays fullscreen.
- Executed so far: 153 payment tests, 176 UI tests, 313 release/flags/retry tests PASS;
  lint, both TypeScript checks, executable billing contract, 41 migration replay and
  paired planner/T20 build PASS. Full suite and protected rollout pending.
- Next: PR review and exact-SHA hosted CI, staging proof, required production reviewer
  approval, production identity/assets/authority proof, then checkout activation and
  authenticated application QR. Paid entitlement acceptance needs the owner's bank
  transfer. Do not describe pending production as complete.
- Final pre-PR review: case/slash route variants align with Router; 245 UI and 48
  retry/process tests PASS. First full local run 7,822 PASS/12 failures; stale Plus
  exclusion fixed and the 11 existing macOS tmp-path fixture failures all pass under
  canonical TMPDIR (93 tests). A final full canonical run and hosted CI remain pending.

## Admin release adapter follow-up (2026-10-17)

The evidence-only checkpoint is 77f81b7bff1c29790a67ea48475aa720a86b9f2e.
It preserves full local runtime evidence on 066c35ad670bc877756150c2055e3844dd7a17ce.
A separate default-disabled release adapter now implements signed, expiry/run/source/
policy/migration-bound operations, live target/source/protection checks, durable
pre-action artifacts, fixed Admin-only migration/bootstrap/recovery paths and
disabled deploy/rollback with compensation attempts. Four manual workflows use
protected dedicated Admin environments and no credential in plan mode.
52 adapter/provider tests passed during development; new exact-SHA full validation
and independent source review are still mandatory. Initial development fixture
key destructuring failed four tests and was fixed before the passing run.
No Cloudflare or production operation occurred. Real identities/protections,
independent human custody, initial resource/enrollment setup, first safe rollback
baseline, live API staging rehearsal and explicit owner authorization remain
blocked. Existing evidence is not relabeled as a test of the adapter.

## Admin release adapter containment follow-up (2026-10-17)

Local candidate adds a dependency-free shutdown Worker/manual containment lane,
correct-route and built-asset negative smoke, paginated account-zone facade route
inventory, signed staging evidence gate, upload-digest-bound pre-action audit,
and approved disabled-version restoration after containment. Candidate validation
and independent review are recorded by exact SHA under
`docs/admin/production-readiness/`; previous 066c35ad results do not certify these
changes. Release execution remains disabled; GitHub account suspension and
staging/operator approval remain external blockers. No remote action occurred.

Admin final source `9395f0e31ea599f1eb7780a8eba36964fed7c483`: all 15 exact-source local verification commands exit 0;
independent release review is retained in docs/admin/production-readiness/13_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md.
Next: restore GitHub access/protections and obtain explicit real staging/resource/operator authorization.
Status remains ADMIN_V1_PRODUCTION_READINESS_BLOCKED / ADMIN_V1_STAGING_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED.

Validation qualification: default-concurrency full suite on 9395f0e3 failed 10 timing checks; full serial rerun uses existing assertions/timeouts. Both attempts are retained in production-readiness evidence and raw output archive; see 12_REGRESSION_RESULTS.md for actual results. Hosted default-concurrency CI remains required.

## Takolio domain staging release checkpoint (2026-10-17)

Status: `DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_IN_PROGRESS`.
Canonical main is `6fc3f3ffa4d5230610acff6e51cf097400652443`, the protected merge
of PR #4. Exact-main CI `39030256282` and Admin CI `39030256276` succeeded.
The approved staging Access Service Auth policy is saved alongside the existing
email Allow policy. Service credentials are stored only in GitHub Environment
staging; no values appear in this source or receipts.

The new manual staging lane audits and preserves current runtime/storage/queue
settings, uploads without traffic activation, verifies uploaded metadata, then
activates staging and attaches two owned hostnames after legacy-URL release
proof. It fences source/current-main/CI, Access credential destinations, domain
ownership and failure/cancellation recovery. Production, Admin, business logic,
migrations and payment settings are outside this adapter's mutation surface.

The owner approved and the browser saved only account `Workers Scripts Read` on
the existing staging token; expiration remains November 16, 2026. Audit
`39035489645` passed the earlier Workers Domains authorization boundary but
stopped before mutation on filtered queue pagination metadata. Cloudflare defines
queue total_count/total_pages without search filters. The audit now reads the
complete unfiltered list, retains completeness checks, and selects one exact
staging queue, rejecting missing/duplicate names. Queue Write remains previously
approved; D1/KV/R2 remain read-only. Fresh hosted audit awaits the reviewed fix.

Current local verification: 350 focused release/domain tests PASS after the queue fix; targeted
ESLint, both TypeScript checks, migration smoke, public scan and whitespace
checks PASS. Build and strict Wrangler upload dry-run passed separately without
upload. The earlier combined check had 8,836 passes and two timing failures;
both existing affected suites passed 74/74 with one worker and unchanged
assertions/timeouts. Full Vitest before the queue fix: 393 files / 8,840 tests PASS (exit 0), `TMPDIR=/private/tmp NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2 --reporter=verbose`; 527.06 seconds. No assertion or timeout was changed. This is a separate successful full-suite run, not a successful rerun of the earlier combined `pnpm check`.

PR #5 is ready for normal independent review. Require exact-head CI and fresh
independent approval before merging, then rerun the fixed exact-main read-only audit. Then require exact-main CI before staging dispatch.
Real Google/OTP/PayOS sandbox, session/PWA/user journeys and rollback rehearsal
remain acceptance gates. A separately reviewed production adapter and independent
production Environment approval are still required. No application upload,
traffic activation, hostname attachment, DNS, data, payment or Admin mutation
has occurred in this checkpoint.

## Restricted staging email preparation - 2026-10-17

The owner-approved test inbox is stored only as staging Environment secret
STAGING_OTP_TEST_RECIPIENT. No native binding or email send has occurred. The
staging release lane now has a false-by-default opt-in for one restricted native
SEND_EMAIL destination. It rejects alternate Resend configuration, other targets
and unrelated binding changes; audits and subsequent releases preserve the exact
restriction. Public receipts redact the address and recovery verifies the original
config commitment after private rehydration. See domain-integration/19.

Validation: 10 domain/release/SW files / 369 tests PASS, full lint exit 0 (two
existing generated-bundle warnings), both TS checks, migrations, build, strict
Wrangler upload dry-run, public scan and diff check PASS. The first new positive
audit test exposed a shared mutable negative-test fixture; deep-cloning its live
metadata fixed fixture isolation without changing assertions/timeouts. Live OTP,
staging acceptance and the reviewed production adapter remain pending.

## Live domain checkpoint - 2026-10-18 JST

PR #9 was independently approved by vn-taphoanhatung at 9752c4bf and merged
normally as 45528f16dd08cb17fdcfd95ee29d5a9953a49275. Approved-head CI
39061857508/Admin CI 39061857592 and exact-main CI 39064033998/Admin CI
39064034053 all succeeded. Each main suite passed 397 files / 8,904 tests;
Admin also passed Worker/migration boundaries, 12 browser cases and 10 keyboard
repetitions. Local sleep-affected full runs remain failed/incomplete.

Fresh read-only staging audit 39065535627 succeeded on this main SHA, preserving
isolated storage/queue/runtime and confirming all 43 migrations. The existing
Access Service Auth token/policy association was verified in native Chrome. Its
Client ID was resynchronized into the existing staging Environment secret without
rotating the secret or changing policy/scope/expiry. Google Console origins were
rechecked: production includes takolio.app; the separate staging client permits
only staging.takolio.app. Real Google login is still NOT RUN.

Staging release 39065618823 failed safely at preflight: Access returned HTTP 302.
The sanitized receipt records mutationAttempted=false and no traffic or hostname
mutation. No upload, email send or production mutation occurred. This exposes the
credential rejection but does not establish its root cause. Native Chrome became
unavailable when macOS locked again; the in-app Cloudflare session is expired.
Owner unlock is required to inspect/repair the authorized credential. Do not
bypass Access or broaden permissions. Actual staging browser/provider/rollback
acceptance and production Environment approval remain required.
Status: DOMAIN_BLOCKED at the live Access preflight; production NOT_CHANGED.

## Access repair and Wrangler output parser fix - 2026-10-18 JST

The existing staging Access service token returned HTTP 302 from the first exact-main
release. Native Chrome confirmed the Service Auth policy still contains only the
approved token, the application contains staging/API hostnames plus frigo-staging
Worker scope, and no extra Require/Exclude rules. The token secret was rotated with
one hour overlap, keeping the same token, policy, permissions and November 16 expiry;
the matching ID/secret pair was saved to the existing staging Environment. A direct
read-only probe of the legacy Worker then returned HTTP 200 and Cloudflare showed the
token Last Seen timestamp updating. No policy or application setting was changed.

The next release passed Access and build but stopped safely while parsing Wrangler's
JSONL output. Wrangler 4.149.0 writes a `wrangler-session` record followed by one
`version-upload` record; the lane incorrectly required exactly one record. The
uploaded version identity was read-only verified as SHA 45528f16 with restricted
SEND_EMAIL binding, while staging traffic remained on b4257b5c. A shared strict
parser now accepts exactly that ordered pair (or a single upload record for backward
compatibility), rejects duplicates/unexpected records/invalid IDs, and is used by
both staging and production adapters. Focused parser/release regression: 467 tests
PASS; lint/typecheck/migrations/build pass (two pre-existing ignored generated-bundle
warnings). A PR is required before the fixed lane can run on protected main.

## PR #10 merged; staging activation reconciled - 2026-10-18 JST

Main is b773431cad032e9bcf385a6abad780e7659aa8c2. PR #10's independent
approval matches a18f2b2b; exact-main CI 39079573250 and Admin CI 39079573261
PASS 398 files / 8,910 tests each. Admin also passes Worker/migration/browser
boundaries, 12 browser cases and ten keyboard runs. Audit 39081283100 PASS.

Release 39081376589 activated the uploaded candidate, then its mutation-response
parser failed. Recovery restored original version b4257b5c but hit the same parser;
its follow-up verification additionally found a false drift from undefined queue
fields dropped during JSON serialization. Fresh read-only audit 39081624560,
deployment history/version reads and authenticated readiness independently prove
original version b4257b5c at 100% under deployment ce74eb29, source f7386e6a,
healthy database, unchanged operations, all 43 migrations and no new hosts/DNS/routes.
The original artifact records failure and is retained unmodified. Raw POST bodies
were not captured; do not assert their exact shape. Production is unchanged.

Branch fix/domain-deployment-reconciliation now retains canonical mutation IDs,
confirms each through deployment-specific and current-traffic reads, and omits
only undefined optional queue fields before comparison/receipt serialization.
Both domain providers use the same confirmation path for activation and recovery.
Initial four focused files / 55 tests PASS; broader/static/build checks pending.
See docs/domain-integration/21-deployment-reconciliation.md. No live retry before
protected review/merge and exact-main checks. Staging acceptance remains pending.

Validation completion for the reconciliation patch: 15 files / 439 targeted tests
PASS; lint (two existing generated-bundle warnings), typecheck, both migration
smokes, Web/Admin/Worker build, Node syntax and diff check PASS. A read-only run of
the new helper confirms restored deployment ce74eb29 and original version via both
specific/current endpoints. No new deployment was created by that probe. Hosted
exact-head CI/Admin CI and independent human review remain next.

PayOS availability correction: PAYOS_CHECKOUT_ENABLED is present among the live
secret binding names. Its absence from ordinary variables does not prove checkout
is disabled; its value and sandbox runtime behavior remain unverified. Preserve
all payment flags and credentials until authorized actual staging acceptance.

## Current checkpoint - PR #11 staging reconciliation - 2026-10-18 JST

PR #11 is merged at `ff3b78a653cc3adaca333ebe637ef44374074a55` after independent approval of reviewed head `44b6fd77` by `vn-taphoanhatung`. Main CI `39083922483` and Admin CI `39083922411` passed; each reports 399 files and 8,931 tests, with Admin migration 23/23, browser 12/12 and keyboard 10/10.

Read-only staging audit `39085897841` passed against the exact main SHA. It confirms candidate version `789192f3-74a4-4c0a-a455-46b8248fb9c0` and deployment `ae036020-1a5b-48ad-aa88-b9eee7e76454` are active on `frigo-staging`; 43 migrations, the staging queue consumer, database/bindings and operational settings are unchanged. It also confirms zero custom domains, zero DNS records and zero Worker routes.

The staging release `39085756138` failed at the first custom-domain attach with HTTP 403 after candidate activation. Its receipt remains `attaching` with no created hostname IDs, and recovery correctly stopped before rollback because ownership was ambiguous. The Cloudflare API specification identifies `Workers Scripts Write` as the permission required by the Worker Domains attach endpoint. Do not retry or expand token scope until the owner explicitly confirms that exact security-sensitive permission change.

Production is unchanged. Production preflight remains warning-level degraded on `CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY` and email delivery is not verified. No production release has been dispatched.

Status: `DOMAIN_BLOCKED`. Live staging acceptance and production cutover remain pending; neither staging nor production is certified.

Next action: reconcile the staging receipt using the logged-in Cloudflare dashboard, confirm the exact token permission needed for Worker Domains, then perform the reviewed staging hostname attach and run live DNS/TLS/Access/auth/OTP/PayOS-sandbox/user-journey/mobile/PWA/rollback checks before requesting production Environment approval.

## Staging hostname response reconciliation - 2026-10-18 JST

Owner-confirmed Workers Scripts Edit was saved to the existing staging token,
preserving expiry and other grants. Audit 39088470405 attempt 2 PASS after one
HTTP 500 read failure. Staging release 39088644278 activated 5f7a12fb under
ae070c36 and proved legacy readiness/assets/authority, then stopped at the first
hostname response. Read-only audit 39088800033 PASS: staging.takolio.app exists
as 5556df933b1ab7756f71ea0e34f349312f2cac45 with one AAAA record; API host is absent;
43 migrations, bindings and operations remain unchanged. Original receipt retained.

A reconciled operator PUT reaffirming identical existing hostname settings proves
the exact incompatibility: response environment is empty, GET environment is
production; all other fields and full domain inventory are equal. No additional
hostname or production mutation occurred. Initial supplementary diagnostic stopped
on read HTTP 403 before mutation. See domain-integration/22 for operation boundaries.

Branch fix/domain-attach-readback persists a valid acknowledged ID then requires
a complete inventory proving exact identity/routing/production environment and
unchanged unrelated domains before claiming ownership. Empty deprecated PUT
environment is the only newly accepted metadata value. Unknown/missing fields,
other environments and failed/drifted reads remain blocked. Existing partial
attachments are never silently claimed or deleted. Live staging acceptance and
production cutover remain pending; fresh hosted CI/review/protected merge required.

Read-back patch validation: 17 files / 454 focused tests PASS; lint (two existing
generated-bundle warnings), both typechecks, customer/Admin migration smoke,
Web/Admin/Worker build, changed-file ESLint, syntax and diff check PASS. Initial
new positive-test hook was corrected after it checked the later read phase.
No local full-suite PASS is claimed; exact-head hosted CI/review remain required.

PR #12 is published at 2e9e733002dfaef1a84464c3078cd6599abe5b33 and independently
approved by vn-taphoanhatung at that exact commit. Hosted CI 39089454566 and
Admin CI 39089454580 are running; do not merge before both succeed. Public scan
passes. Public DNS for staging resolves via 1.1.1.1 and valid TLS returns Access
HTTP 302; the local network resolver still returns NXDOMAIN, preventing browser
acceptance. Owner confirmation is pending for a temporary Chrome Secure DNS
change and restoration. No network settings have been changed.
Production read-only readiness at 02:23 UTC remains source 526596a8, database OK,
status degraded with CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY and email delivery false.
No production dispatch. Supplemental receipts and current evidence are retained
in the parent workspace outputs/evidence without changing the failed receipt.

## PR #12 protected merge and DNS continuation - 2026-10-18 UTC

Verified exact-head independent approval and successful CI 39089454566 / Admin
CI 39089454580, then merged normally to 2dbe74bac990860cb44f96acc39877c471846df6.
Exact-main CI 39091692776 and Admin CI 39091692765 are running. The parent
workspace watcher wait-pr12-main-audit.py dispatches only a read-only staging
audit after both pass and current main still equals that SHA. No staging release
or production mutation has been dispatched at this checkpoint.

The owner confirmed a temporary Chrome Secure DNS change with restoration. The
UI shows Secure DNS disabled by managed-browser policy; no setting was changed.
Current network DNS and 1.1.1.1 both resolve staging. Clearing Chrome's stale host
cache also made its DNS lookup succeed, without changing privacy/network settings.
Browser navigation reaches Access, then attempts its api-staging SSO hostname,
which is not attached yet. In-app Chromium still reports name resolution failure.
Fresh staging release after exact-main checks/audit remains the next dependency.

Production token scope is restored to its original 11 permissions after an
accidental premature permission-save was immediately reversed and disclosed.
Only a new owner action-time confirmation may authorize adding account Workers
Scripts Edit. Existing Environment prevent_self_review and can_admins_bypass=false
were rechecked; reviewer remains vn-taphoanhatung. No production dispatch.

Owner subsequently confirmed adding Workers Scripts Edit to the production token.
It was saved after that confirmation and the UI now lists 12 permissions including
Workers Scripts Write, with original policies and November 16 expiration retained.
No token value was shown or copied and no production workflow was dispatched.
Public readiness via ordinary curl at 03:04 UTC returned HTTP 200, source 526596a8,
DB OK, config.ok=true with the existing authority warning and email delivery false.

## Current CORS and deletion checkpoint - 2026-10-18 JST

This checkpoint supersedes earlier pending CI/audit statements. Exact-main CI
39091692776/Admin CI 39091692765 PASS at 2dbe74ba, 8,956 tests each. Production
infrastructure audit 39093057999 was independently approved and PASS. Post-failure
staging infrastructure audit 39093604510 PASS; this is not browser acceptance.
Release 39093031910 activated 5ce93d26 under d50174ac and failed at API preflight.
Read-only full account inventory exactly matches its original inventory: existing
web hostname retained, created API hostname absent; candidate traffic still active.

Branch fix/domain-cors-delete-proof adds bounded empty DELETE response handling,
strict journal/inventory/fence reconciliation without repeating DELETE, Access
HTTP 200/Worker HTTP 204 CORS verification, actual GET CORS and denied-origin
checks. The initial focused regression reproduced two failures. Final selections
pass 252 tests/20 files and 79 tests/5 files; full lint, both types, migration smoke
and Web/Admin/Worker build pass with existing bundle/font warnings. See domain-
integration/23-cors-and-detach-reconciliation.md for remaining uncertainty and gates.

Dashboard confirms Access CORS is empty; public staging OPTIONS returns 403.
Restricted CORS is prepared but NOT SAVED while owner action-time confirmation
is pending. No production release, acceptance attestation or live browser/provider
PASS exists. Next: protected PR/review/CI, save owner-approved CORS, exact-main
checks and staging release, actual nine-check acceptance, fresh production
certification and separately approved protected cutover.

# Admin console takeover - 2026-10-18

Canonical repository: `hello-tako/Takolio` (ID `1422954151`), main baseline
`571f3c229696d6bc766de89f552a36f48ca92e58`. Isolated branch:
`codex/admin-production-readiness-20261018`; local verification is recorded in docs/admin/production-readiness/20_CURRENT_VERIFICATION.md; publication/hosted results must be read from the PR.

Admin governance now follows the owner's single-owner decision: one enrolled
SUPER_ADMIN and one owner signing key are sufficient. The affected target cannot
approve itself; the last usable owner is protected. Schema 4 preserves old
records and revokes existing sessions on auth-mode change. Added audited owner
enrollment, disabled initialization/enable operations, exact target/provider
checks, offline owner signing, sanitized read-only infrastructure audit and
failure containment. PayOS, payment, customer runtime/migrations and customer
release paths were not changed.

Verified locally: Admin unit/integration suite 22 files / 348 tests PASS; final metadata delta 4/4, workerd 10/10, D1 matrix 25/25, browser 12/12, keyboard 10/10, lint, typecheck, build, migration smoke, dependency audit, public scan and diff checks PASS. Whole-project regression is running; hosted CI must verify the published SHA. Real Admin Cloudflare resources, dedicated Access app,
protected Admin Environments and ST01-ST20 staging evidence are
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`; no Admin production mutation occurred.

## Admin dedicated credential stored - 2026-10-18 11:44 UTC

The owner-created Cloudflare token was verified active (expiry
2026-11-18T14:59:59Z) and stored via CLI stdin as
ADMIN_RELEASE_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN in protected admin-staging/admin-production.
Both GitHub secret metadata readbacks passed. The GET-only local audit on
629614da observed all seven sections, including both exact Access app IDs,
audiences and expected issuer. Sanitized evidence and attribution are in
production-readiness/23_CREDENTIAL_STORAGE_RECEIPT.md. This is local metadata
verification, not a protected-run receipt or staging acceptance.
PR #16 review/CI, GitHub metadata credential, owner signing key and actual verified
Access subject remain pending. Admin policy/execution remains disabled; no
Admin Worker upload, migration, HMAC/bootstrap or production deployment occurred.

## Owner key review checkpoint - 2026-10-18

The owner asked to inspect PR #16 and authorized creating a new local Ed25519 key.
Generated private/public files and a local recovery copy outside Git with 0600
file/0700 directory modes. Restored-key challenge signing verified. Public-key
fingerprint is be0258713682a00e18a218e6523994716446a1c28e18935d7a2a34f6158cb316;
proposed signer owner-20261018 is in both release-policy targets, still disabled.
Private material is not in GitHub or workflow secrets. Actual Access subject,
independent offline backup/custody, GitHub metadata token and final-head review
remain pending. Initial plan attempts after editing refused the dirty checkout;
there was no attempted remote execution. See production-readiness/24_OWNER_PUBLIC_KEY_REVIEW.md.

Owner-key proposal verification PASS: 4 files / 92 tests, lint, both TypeScript
checks, disabled-target/key fingerprint contract, public patch scan and diff.
pnpm audit snapshot reported all severity counts zero; no claim is made that
GitHub's separately reported default-branch Dependabot findings are resolved.

## Admin commissioning merged - 2026-10-18 12:38 UTC

PR #16 exact-head review and both required checks PASS (406 files / 9,045 tests).
Protected merge is 61a34b74d749ef1d6dfe42e74df74d79cb67ff50. Exact-main CI
39127790356/Admin CI 39127790370 remain in progress at this checkpoint.
Protected staging GET audit 39127939910 PASS after vn-taphoanhatung approval;
all seven metadata sections observed, dedicated resources/Access match, no Admin
Workers/domains deployed. Artifact 12136509550 is retained with its exact source
and digest in admin/production-readiness/25_POST_MERGE_RELEASE_CHECKPOINT.md.
Production GET audit 39127977644 awaits reviewer. Owner authorized agent browser
approval, but concurrent window changes interrupted production UI operations.

Release remains disabled. Token rotation/re-audit, GitHub read credential,
verified Access subject, off-machine key recovery, reviewed activation and actual
ST01-ST20 remain PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE. The existing Cloudflare secret still
has its original storage timestamp. No Admin live release write occurred.
Merged-source local plan correctly refused disabled targets; Admin build and
Wrangler dry-run PASS. Production customer health via curl: HTTP 200, DB ok,
existing recipe authority warning. Evidence-only follow-up is not release source.

At 12:49 UTC, production GET audit 39127977644 also SUCCESS after actual reviewer
vn-taphoanhatung approval; all seven sections and exact target matches verified.
Both reports state readyForDeployment=false, remoteMutations=false. Secret
metadata now confirms ADMIN_RELEASE_GITHUB_READ_TOKEN exists in both Admin
Environments, updated 12:39:49/12:40:06 UTC; its contents/scopes were not read.
Cloudflare secret timestamps remain 11:43 UTC, so rotation is not certified.
Owner Access subject and independent off-machine recovery still require evidence.
Main CI/Admin CI are still running. No live Admin release write occurred.

# Rotated Admin credential verification - 2026-10-18

Fresh protected GET-only Admin credential audits after the owner's Cloudflare
rotation succeeded on exact main `61a34b74d749ef1d6dfe42e74df74d79cb67ff50`:
`39135545563` (staging, artifact `12139143437`, digest
`sha256:e17301fd8a36b2a9446a896e4f5b333ae86769ce540f806fd4d79c6ffe01a558`) and
`39135545460` (production, artifact `12139304681`, digest
`sha256:55f2e782f7e23964734a4b3d5b1015b061e58b922d5ef7de2850b9420e1b3bd5`).
Both were approved by `vn-taphoanhatung`; all seven sections are `OBSERVED`,
with `remoteMutations=false` and `readyForDeployment=false`.

Admin release policy remains disabled. Owner-supplied Drive backup evidence and
the App Launcher error do not yet establish independently recoverable key custody
or a verified Access subject. No Admin Worker, migration, enrollment, bootstrap,
enablement or production deployment has occurred.

## Protected HMAC follow-up candidate

A separate branch `codex/admin-hmac-provisioning-20261018` implements the missing
initial HMAC step in the signed, protected Admin Operator Ceremony lane. The new
finite `provision-hmac` operation accepts an empty payload, uses in-memory random
keys, writes only mapped Admin/Facade Worker secrets and requires schema/identity,
disabled-console and zero authority/session/audit/fixture-history checks. Every
PUT rechecks the protected source/approval/artifact and unused authority. A fresh
signed initial retry may replace a partial key set only before authority exists;
operational audit-key rotation remains prohibited. No live action was performed.
Validation and exact-head review status belong to this follow-up, not PR #17.
See production-readiness/27_PROTECTED_HMAC_PROVISIONING.md.

# Admin release checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

Main is `0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`; exact-main CI `39289222795`
and Admin CI `39289223049` are PASS. Protected staging rollback `39292571221`,
deploy-disabled `39293405049`, and enable `39294320059` are PASS with verified
run-bound authorization, pre-action receipts and artifact digests. The disabled
baseline was Admin `e38bfb72-8614-4b9f-b3e3-ef3fdf0824eb` / facade
`4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`; the enabled staging Admin is
`22c714f5-b281-4f9c-8a90-78292df78db4` with the same facade.

Post-enable anonymous Access-boundary checks passed 12/12 with invalid assertion
and role headers, and customer health returned HTTP 200/status=ok. Authenticated
owner smoke on the new SHA could not be completed because the Mac locked while
opening the Cloudflare Access continuation. ST03-ST07, ST09, ST12, ST15 and the
remaining partial ST08/ST10/ST13/ST16/ST18/ST19 rows stay pending or partial;
The corrected protected rollback component is PASS; full exact-source ST20 remains incomplete. No staging certificate was
signed, and no Admin production operation ran. Production remains blocked by
incomplete exact-source live evidence, not by the removed staffing quorum.

## Admin continuation checkpoint - 2026-10-20 JST

`0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa` is still the exact protected main source. Owner Access smoke is complete on the new source, including authenticated dashboard/API reads, audit/settings, successful preference save, logout and `ADMIN_UNAUTHENTICATED` after logout. Exact-source protected emergency disable `39331453601`, rollback `39331742184`, and re-enable `39332174066` all PASS; the final enabled staging Admin is `e7ed80bd-26cb-4e33-a658-0cf298412af0`, facade `4dbf1918-e8cc-4162-b06a-bc377ab23f57`. Anonymous boundary and customer health rechecks PASS. Production Admin was not mutated.

The release gate remains closed because the signed all-PASS ST01-ST20 certificate contract is not met. Missing live evidence includes foreign issuer/audience/expired token, unauthorized/unprivileged/other-role identity, hostile-origin CSRF, invalid facade operations, concurrency/recovery, complete credential-field scan, automated real-host axe/load/JWKS rotation and full customer regression. Keep all such rows `PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE` or `PARTIAL`; do not infer PASS from synthetic fixtures or owner-only smoke.

The owner users API payload scan observed 21 items and no forbidden credential fields; only this read-only, owner-authenticated response is covered. Production plan-only run `39333366228` passed with execution skipped and made no mutation.

## Production dispatch recheck - 2026-10-20 10:31 UTC

The requested production deployment was rechecked against exact main
`0307fc1032624f38321a894b164c030b73849faa`. Read-only checks passed for branch
protection, exact-main CI references, production Environment reviewer policy and
the existing production plan artifact. Workflow `39333366228` remains
`plan=success` with `execute=skipped`; no production Admin mutation occurred.

The protected release adapter still requires an owner-signed
`ADMIN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION` whose exact-source report has all ST01-ST20 set
to `PASS`. The current unsigned evidence remains 6 PASS, 6 PARTIAL and 8
`PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE`; the certification secret is absent from the
production Environment. Therefore no execute dispatch was attempted, because it
would fail closed before Cloudflare credentials or production mutation.

Checks executed: `gh run view 39333366228`, production Environment policy and
secret inventory readback, `git diff --check`, and
`python3 scripts/admin-public-scan.py` (PASS). Next action remains obtaining
real missing staging evidence, signing the exact-source certificate, then
running the protected production commissioning sequence.

## Owner session closure - 2026-10-20

The latest owner-authenticated staging session was explicitly logged out and
returned to `/admin/login`. A follow-up navigation to
`/api/v1/admin/me` redirected to the Cloudflare Access sign-in page, confirming
that the session no longer had an authenticated Admin response. No token,
cookie or credential value was copied into evidence or chat. This closes the
browser-session limitation only; it does not close the remaining live ST03-ST19
evidence or create a staging certificate.

## 2026-10-20 QA identity lifecycle continuation

Implemented, but not yet merged or commissioned, a staging-only signed QA identity lifecycle on branch `codex/admin-staging-test-identities-20261020`.
Migration `0005_admin_staging_test_identities.sql` preserves the runtime schema-4 contract and adds an append-only enrollment/revocation ceremony. The release adapter accepts only `enroll-staging-test` and `revoke-staging-test` in the protected breakglass workflow, rejects production, binds the exact owner signature/run/SHA, limits aliases to the enrolled owner's `+takolio-qa-` mailbox, grants no role/recovery key/password, and atomically revokes roles/sessions with audit on cleanup.

Local verification: 285 focused Admin tests PASS before the current-schema provider rerun; migration matrix 25/25 PASS; admin schema smoke PASS; TypeScript typecheck PASS; Admin production build PASS (three existing font-resolution warnings, emitted fonts verified); public scan and diff check PASS. The full targeted Admin JSON suite completed with exit 0; expected jsdom error logging from the remediation UI test is retained by that existing test.

No Cloudflare Access policy was saved, no OTP was sent, no live identity was enrolled, no staging D1 mutation was executed, and no production mutation/deploy occurred in this continuation. Access expansion is awaiting action-time confirmation; live ST03-ST19 evidence and the exact-source staging certificate remain pending.

## 2026-10-20 staging policy and compatibility checkpoint

The owner-confirmed Cloudflare staging Access policy is saved with the existing
owner email plus exactly five `+takolio-qa-*` aliases. Production policy was not
changed. No OTP, cookie, JWT, secret or private key was copied into chat or Git;
the sanitized screenshot receipt is ignored under `.artifacts/admin-live-20261020/test-identities/`.

The compatibility edits preserve the runtime Admin schema-4 contract while
requiring the complete five-file migration ledger. Local verification is PASS:
219 focused tests, migration matrix 25/25, workerd checks 10/10, schema smoke,
typecheck, Admin build, lint with two pre-existing generated-bundle warnings,
public scan and diff check. Fresh CI and independent review on the new PR HEAD
remain required before merge; live Access subject capture, staging QA role
acceptance, certificate signing and production deployment remain pending.
