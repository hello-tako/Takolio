# Admin Console R2 local continuation — 2026-10-15

**Status:** ADMIN_V1_R2_CHANGES_REQUIRED; implementation/integration in progress,
not ready for independent review, staging or production. Work is local on
`feat/admin-v1-r2-isolation-governance`; do not push, merge PR #77, deploy, access
remote D1, change credentials or activate resources. Report/package:
`docs/admin/remediation-r2/REPORT.md` (not an independent certification).

**Source:** verified initial handoff `87d6d3d2acc69a6ca3f0409c3c22753469807222`;
main `0ff82ed` is a parent of merge `a2f47c5`, which preserves all main-side
lines in the four conflicted docs/ai status files. Customer protected runtime
paths and migrations 0001–0043 were unchanged by this continuation.
WP0 checkpoint `a0662040`: migration matrix14/14, workerd108/108, E2E12/12,
lint/types/build/customer+admin migration smoke passed before R2 edits.
Full-suite two-worker run: 8,574 pass / 1 family-planner30s timeout; isolated
family-planner3/3 pass does not make the whole run PASS. Fresh full proof pending.

**Changes under integration:** separate internal facade and no Admin customer DB
binding; issuer/subject validation; independent operator enrollment and offline
signed recovery; atomic role/approval guards; bootstrap/audit hardening; bounded
reads/caching; keyboard/screenshot/deep-link regressions. Customer auth/schema,
payment runtime and release gates remain protected. Historical R1 evidence stays.

**Environment failure:** unrequested Modal replacement generation3→4 at ~07:38UTC
restored an old snapshot and lost uncommitted R2 edits and active checks. Code is
being recovered from retained context into local checkpoint commits, beginning
`12fbacaa`/`2ddc5f7f`/`c6de26ee`; platform feedback filed. Partial/reconstruction
checks are not final evidence. No publication or remote resource operation occurred.

**Next:** complete reconstruction/integration, freeze an implementation commit,
run the full required local gates plus original/adversarial PoCs, workerd and
browser proof, review the diff, and finalize the exact-SHA R2 evidence package.

# T25 staging D1 column-limit correction - 2026-10-15 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; product source merged, staging migration stopped
before mutation. PR75 merged final head bdb5014d67b3b13688db1746bd07c3c5b5bacd5c
as main a07b308c6997947c59a9e5f6ecf715b6b1eb573a. Exact-head CI38581755662
and exact-main CI38583565990 both PASS: 359 files / 8,440 tests, respectively
589.91s and 592.25s; lint/types/migration smoke/build PASS. Merge tree equals
reviewed head and preserves ancestry.

**Hosted failure:** staging migration38585376230 attempt1 at main a07b308c
failed during pre-health. Identity pinned to frigo-db-staging-v3 /
7854298a-20f5-46aa-9cbf-917079c2a3dd, complete ledger41/tip0041 and Time Travel
bookmark were certified. Actual bookmark step PASS; failure followed generated
baseline SQL. Apply step was SKIPPED; no application deployment or production
migration/deploy occurred. Redirected remote stdout was not uploaded, so its exact
error text is unavailable. Sanitized receipt remains in scratch.

**Cause and narrow correction:** baseline SQL returned103 columns, above D1's
SQLITE_LIMIT_COLUMN100. The exact SQL deterministically fails with SQLite CLI
column100 (`too many columns in result set`) and passes with103. Official
Cloudflare limits and workerd SQLite security setup confirm100. Split only the
aggregate query into84+19 columns, preserving all103 counts across83 legacy tables
and catalog/media diagnostics. Strict parsing and persisted-baseline validation
retain fail-closed drift/identity/ledger/schema/CI gates. No product/runtime,
applied migration, auth/payment, dependency or production configuration change.

**Verification:** focused migration/workflow checks PASS: 4 files / 70 tests
(6.55s), including 12 direct family-migration regressions. Full lint, scoped
ESLint and diff check PASS. Independent review found no actionable issue.
Native Wrangler4.149/workerd local D1 reproduced the old103-column SQLITE_ERROR;
new84+19 results PASS, with all103values equal to0041 and0043 references.
Only an isolated local D1 received43migrations. New exact-head and exact-main
hosted CI remain required before staging retry.
User chooses automated checks/public hosted smoke; authenticated product flows
remain NOT_TESTED. Existing production reviewer vn-taphoanhatung is required.

**Next:** verify narrow correction; normal PR/merge and exact-main CI; run staging
migration/deploy/smoke at the resulting immutable SHA; then protected production
0041->0043 and shadow0->canary1->5->25->d1/0. Preserve previous receipts, all gates
and additive schema on recovery. No production-success claim.
# T25 hosted CI timeout correction - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; PR75 final candidate CI retry pending.
Commit2ffebf44 remains the verified release-tooling baseline. Hosted CI38579146408
failed only three 5-second timeouts in scoped-picker quantity integration tests:
8,437 passed / 3 failed, 358 files passed / 1 failed, total8,440 tests/359 files.
The failing cases took5.215-5.272s; nearby green multi-request cases took4.5-4.8s.
An isolated unchanged local rerun passed28/28. The fixture replays43 migrations,
500 recipes and several Worker requests; comparable functional fixtures use30s.

**Correction:** scoped30-second test deadlines on the three functional suites in
`t20-scoped-picker-quantity.test.ts`. All assertions and separate evaluation/query/
pool/performance-bound tests remain intact; no runtime or global CI policy change.
Focused picker and performance checks run before the follow-up commit. Previous
full local8440PASS remains recorded; final exact-head hosted CI must pass.

**Authorization:** user chooses automated checks and public hosted smoke; no
signed-in hosted household product acceptance is claimed. No remote migration or
new deployment has happened. Existing Environment reviewer gate is preserved.

**Next:** push the narrow correction and actual focused evidence, require successful
exact-head CI, normal merge/exact-main CI, then staging and protected production
sequence in tasks/T25-family-meals-production-release.md.

# T25 family meals production release - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** RELEASE_IN_PROGRESS; local release tooling verified. User authorizes
gathering T22-T24 and releasing production. Branch
`codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013`; PR https://github.com/hello-tako/Tako-san/pull/75.
Source baseline d64ba0c9; product checkpoints 6b63606d / d3952c34 / cf54910f.
Active packet `tasks/T25-family-meals-production-release.md`; accepted ADR-061.

**Delivered:** bounded current-main staging 0041->0042->0043 migration/certification;
production current-main/CI fences and exact family schema proof; post-media catalog
support for 0042/0043; inactive same-candidate paired flags-OFF recovery with exact

and paired flags verified before upload. Schema remains additive on rollback.
No payment/auth runtime, dependency, production config or applied migration edits.

**Executed:** final full `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=2` PASS,

**Failures retained:** initial full run 8,438 passed / 2 failed: inherited Wrangler
5-second startup timeout (isolated32/32 PASS unchanged) and obsolete one-build-only
workflow assertion. The assertion now checks every allowed explicit paired build

version/ledger through new pipeline; do not copy historical IDs.

**Next:** push this checkpoint, require exact-head CI and normal ancestry-preserving
merge, exact-main CI, staging migration/deploy at D1 with paired flags ON, then
protected production migration0041->0043. Production restarts shadow/0 with explicit
rollback confirmation, promotes sameSHA canary1->5->25->D1/0, verifies each receipt.
GitHub production Environment reviewer vn-taphoanhatung remains required. No gate
bypass or production-success claim. A used recovery must prove served OFF assets;
no live recovery rehearsal occurred. Aggregate preservation is not byte-content/R2
proof. Authenticated hosted family flows need an existing certification session.

# T23 fridge quantities, manual selection and continued-week shopping - 2026-10-14 JST

**Status:** LOCAL_IMPLEMENTED_VERIFIED. Branch
codex/vietnamese-family-meals-20261013. Base T22 documentation checkpoint
c465bd1baf94246b8a591d07971343c245ad424a. Verified implementation checkpoint
d3952c34b1c217fb695cd551a247c0882c4c01d7. Active packet tasks/T23-quantity-aware-manual-planning.md;
accepted architecture ADR-059, extending ADR-058. No push, merge, remote migration
or deployment. Local evidence is not hosted or production acceptance.

**Implemented:** intentional persisted empty manual calendars; explicit add versus
named replacement from recipes/saved dishes; canonical role selection; exact
required/from-fridge/missing amounts at destination servings; earlier meals and
shared ingredients reserve stock once; downstream no-buy/cook-now consistency;
locked selections survive assisted completion. Manual complete_meal mains use a
one-dish template for that slot; ordinary family dinners retain their groups.
Discovery/detail/calendar/cooking links retain servings; uncertain/offline cooking
attempts freeze count and deductions. Fractional measured stock entry/correction
uses exact compatible unit display conversion and original draft revision fences.
Shopping keeps explicit purchase edits and retires only successful command keys.

**Integrity and compatibility:** scoped picker snapshots bind plan/loaded revision,
slot/date/type/servings/replacement and current inputs, including elapsed-slot
identities; later reads cannot authorize a calculation from an older revision.
Numeric sequence breaks equal-time ties consistently. Membership and atomic
inventory/profile/catalog fences remain. Strict existing family/V1 response keys
are retained; richer quantities require opt-in assessments. Source cache seeds
are refreshed before quantities can be selected. Corrective removal stays possible.

Future V2 meals remain editable after earlier meals elapse. Current projections
skip elapsed instants rather than reserving current stock for them again. Shared
family shopping can recalculate future demand after inventory/history/time changes;
profile/hard preference/catalog/authority staleness still blocks it, and freshness
remains truthful. Trip defaults/minimum use the saved plan offset, including late
same-day meals when the device's date differs. Time is captured at request start.
Legacy price optimization, V1 swapping and whole-week regeneration retain strict
past-horizon gates; individual future meals can be edited/completed. No calendar,
shopping generation or checkbox deducts physical inventory.

**Executed gates:** Node v25.9.0 / pnpm 10.33.2. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`
(both projects), `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=4`
(354 files / 8,332 tests,232.84s), `pnpm check:migrations` (42 migrations),
`GIT_COMMIT=local-t23-family-planning pnpm build`, and
`GIT_COMMIT=local-t23-family-planning VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true
VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED=true pnpm build` PASS. Audit
`pnpm audit --audit-level=high` PASS, no known vulnerabilities; dependency/config/
migration bytes unchanged by T23. Focused backend 38 tests and latest UI/calendar
150 tests PASS. Final typecheck confirmed by root. `git diff --check` and protected
path/source review PASS. Full tests/browser/builds ran sequentially; no combined
`pnpm check`, hosted CI or production success is claimed. The later E2E-only URL
matcher fix did not change runtime or the full unit/integration test graph.

**Running-app evidence:** `PORT=3101 PREVIEW_API_PORT=8891 pnpm exec playwright
test -c playwright.family.config.ts` 8/8 PASS (3.5m),320/390/768/1280. Actual
browser/app/Worker HTTP uses synthetic catalog/SQLite D1 fixtures without business
API interception in family flows. Manual calendar, servings, exact rice320g,
add/replace/completion/one-dish reload, shopping3->7->3 and changed-stock continuation
are verified. Inventory stays unchanged by these planning/shopping actions. Axe
and horizontal-overflow assertions PASS in tested surfaces; screenshots visually
reviewed. `PORT=3104 PREVIEW_API_PORT=8894 pnpm exec playwright test -c
playwright.t20.config.ts` 42/42 PASS (3.7m),390/768/1280. Its negative load/fallback tests explicitly
intercept selected responses. Targeted recovery/fallback 6/6 PASS (32.9s). These
local Chromium fixtures do not certify hosted workerd/D1, real users or retention.

**Failures retained:** earlier full T23 run exposed three inherited inventory UI
conversion expectations, fixed with unit-only versus explicit correction semantics.
Preview login stalls showed Vite504 Outdated Optimize Dep (zustand); concurrent
Vitest/browser attempts were interrupted (exit130), followed by isolated runs.
One earlier build was interrupted after Vite and is not a pass. Legacy T20 fixture
helpers needed actual cuisine/role, idle-state and optional price-panel interactions.
Final compatibility attempt retained 2failed/1interrupted/20passed/19notrun (exit130):
load/fallback interceptors omitted the new includeAssessment query. Matching the
exact pathname and proving an actual failed read fixed the cause without weakening
assertions; targeted6 and final42 then PASS. Missing test imports/router fixture
shape in early continuation checks were fixed; failures/logs remain retained.
Independent final review found the trip device-date mismatch, fixed with actual
payload/minimum and midnight regressions. No remaining confirmed review finding.

**Database and limits:** T23 adds no schema/migration. T22's0042 remains required
before releasing any Worker route using family/profile/favorites/shared-shopping
storage, including planner flags OFF; preserve additive schema on rollback.
No new remote/local D1 apply is needed for T23. Unknown shopping demand has no
purchase/resolve/dismiss command; manual entries do not reconcile it. No guessed
package/bunch/piece mass, leftovers/shared prep/multi-vendor allocation, independently
verified all-catalog regional provenance or clinical nutrition/allergy certification.
No future-only whole-week regeneration and no proven retention improvement.
Research distinguishes Hanoi qualitative evidence, public guidance, product decisions
and implemented behavior. Source/log/screenshot receipts are in the calling chat's
outputs/t23-verified directory; scratch work/ and node_modules are not committed.

**Next action:** separately authorize normal PR/exact-head and exact-main CI, then
migration-first staging and hosted smoke of both planner flags before protected
production release. Product follow-up: define an explicit unknown-demand review
contract, validate regional metadata and run a multi-region household diary/task
study. Keep payment/auth/infrastructure/config/dependencies/applied migrations
outside this task. Historical checkpoints follow unchanged.

accepted architecture ADR-058. No push, merge, remote migration or deployment.

**Implemented:** whole-week Vietnamese-first family lunch/dinner compositions;
breakfast/quick/one-pot templates; revisioned member meal habits wired into
schedule/servings/regions/time/cuisine and shopping cadence; private saved recipes
and picker; per-dish swap/lock/save; current-composition truthful board/composer;
trip-scoped shared shopping with exact compatible demand, familiar fraction display,
collapsed source dishes, purchase edits, offline receipt overlays, mutually exclusive bought/cannot-buy,
dismissal and original command replay. Mobile list precedes manual entry.
Physical inventory remains unchanged by generation/shopping/checking.

**Integrity and compatibility:** sequential whole-week stock projection;
current inventory/expiry/storage/profile/ranking/catalog witnesses guard
computed planning, proposal, composition and shopping-materialization writes
atomically; explicit profile/favorite/manual shopping commands use their own
membership and revision guards; strict V1 read shape retained; paired-flag-off V1 writes reject
stored family plans without optional-schema reads. Locked foreign mains reserve
rolling seven-day allowance, including future preserved slots; lowered cap warns
without removing choices. Companion repetition is soft across the horizon,
staple repetition allowed. Hard time is all-component prep+cook; unknown time is
visible. All-unplanned hard-time requests return valid strict DTOs. Onboarding
hydrates saved household size without replacing an explicit local selection.

**Executed gates:** Node v25.9.0 / pnpm 10.33.2. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`
(both projects), `TMPDIR=/private/tmp pnpm test --maxWorkers=4`
(347 files / 8180 tests), `pnpm check:migrations`
(42 migrations), `GIT_COMMIT=local-vietnamese-family-meals pnpm build`, and
`GIT_COMMIT=local-vietnamese-family-meals VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true
VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED=true pnpm build` PASS.
`pnpm audit --audit-level=high` PASS; dependencies unchanged.
Local `pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply frigo-db --local` and
`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm schema:check:local` PASS; ledger 42 through 0042.
`git diff --check` and protected-path/migration checks PASS. No combined
`pnpm check`, hosted CI or production success is claimed for this branch.

**Running-app evidence:** `pnpm exec playwright test -c
playwright.family.config.ts` 4/4 PASS at 320/390/768/1280 with actual app/Worker
HTTP and synthetic SQLite/catalog fixtures, no API interception. Axe zero on
board/composer/favorites/shopping; no horizontal overflow in tested flows.
Actual local workerd/D1 on 8794 (catalog=d1, AI off) independently created 7/7
four-role dinners, 0 partial/unplanned/generated international meals, materialized 20
shopping demand keys (3 unresolved / 17 known items), retained 777.5 purchase quantity,
bought/cannot-buy and favorite count 1 across reads; inventory unchanged. Local receipt
and fresh browser screenshots copied to the calling chat's outputs/implemented-app.
This is local synthetic evidence, not hosted smoke or user retention validation.

**Failures retained:** an early full run had 16 failed files / 55 failed tests,
including UI/provider/capture compatibility failures. A later run identified
role-distribution and schema-gate hash failures; reviewed seven-recipe role delta
and expand-only 0042 pin fixed them, with focused regressions. First mid-edit root
typecheck failed an unknown `search.limits` guard; explicit object narrowing and
final both-project pass followed. One workerd attempt restarted during an active
request; later frozen-source run PASS. Early macOS temp-path capture failures
require TMPDIR=/private/tmp. A concurrent build failed with "Service Worker build
token was not found" and a concurrent browser attempt showed a blank page before
the Language control. Their root cause is unproven. Final isolated default and
paired builds exited 0; final isolated Chromium was 4/4 PASS in 1.2 minutes.
Earlier passing counts (8137/346 and 8161/346) remain historical; final source is
347 files / 8180 tests. Failed logs remain retained and are not reported green.

**Limits/release order:** regional preference uses existing catalog metadata;
not every regional attribution is independently verified. No clinical nutrition,
assumed package/piece mass, parallel-cooking estimate, or full-week preview/apply
workflow. Direct regeneration has explicit confirmation. Apply 0042 before this
Worker serves any traffic, even planner flags OFF, because shopping/favorites/
profile routes use new tables independently. Retain additive schema on rollback;
paired flag-off on current guarded Worker is the locally tested rollback path.
A pre-T22 Worker after family plans exist is not certified for rollback.

**Next action:** independent review of this checkpoint, then separately authorized
normal PR/exact-head and exact-main CI, migration-first staging, paired flags and
hosted smoke before protected production release. Keep payment/auth runtime,
config/dependencies/protected workflows and old migrations unchanged.

**Actual acceptance:** after protected release, admission enabled on both Workers.
Production temporary monthly2000VND offer was issued by the real authenticated

# payOS billing account, QR recovery and temporary offer - 2026-10-13 JST

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_VERIFIED; hosted checks and new protected
staging/production release remain pending. Branch
codex/payos-billing-account-20261013 starts at production b7358ea4 (PR73).
Explicit owner authorization covers this payment work, protected production
release and temporary monthly2000VND; canonical monthly49000/annual499000 remain
source defaults. No new migration, auth policy or release protection change.

**Implemented:** GET billing/account returns a no-store owner snapshot of current
entitlement/expiry, recent20 payment records and an all-history outstanding fence.
The Plus UI adds package management, renewal, truthful history and owned saved-QR
reopening after reload. Session-generation/owner fences discard late responses
and retained callbacks. Loading/error blocks new creation. Atomic D1 admission
prevents concurrent different-key and unkeyed duplicate orders; same-key replay
retains original persisted amount and instructions. Remote uncertainty remains
blocked for reconciliation unless the payment is already verified paid with its
persisted provider reference; that rare lost-create-response race no longer
blocks renewal. Legacy QR instructions were never saved and are not
fabricated; old pending orders wait for expiry if no transfer was made.

**Guest follow-up:** planner-enabled Home and Planner show an explicit login CTA
for guests, skip registered-only reads and fence retained authenticated callbacks;
server guest403 and legacy Week behavior remain intact.

fixtures verified desktop1280/mobile390 without horizontal overflow; free, active
Plus/expiry/renewal, pending reopen, legacy unavailableQR, expired, read-error and
guest Planner states match expected UI. No fixture dispatches provider/mutations.
First full attempt failed due scratch review tests accidentally discovered and
legacy planner fixtures inheriting globalT20 build flags; scratch preserved outside
repo and V1 fixtures now explicitly isolate flags, with trueT20 tests retained.
Static Plus rendering also needed a fail-closed browser session capture guard.
No new live UI or2000VND offer is claimed yet; deployed source remains b7358ea4.

**Next:** normal PR/main CI,
protected staging then production deployment. Verify exact assets/runtime/D1,
then enable CHECKOUT_ADMISSION_ENABLED and PAYOS_TEST_MONTHLY_PRICE_VND=2000.
Create/reopen a true2000VND app QR; owner performs transfer. Confirm real provider
payment, persisted paid intent and Plus expiry before deleting the temporary
price secret to restore49000. No fake payment or direct entitlement grant.

# payOS / Plus shell production checkpoint - 2026-10-12 JST

**Status:** PRODUCTION_OPERATIONAL; paid-settlement acceptance and follow-up
registered-planner guest UI correction remain pending. PR73 merged as
b7358ea4146226a929aa1e20513c2f98f77b7092. Hosted main CI38260918278 PASS:
337 files / 7966 tests, lint/types/41 migrations/build. Protected staging
38262309375 and production38262862169 PASS on attempt1, with actual production
reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. Immutable artifact ID, pre-upload-only retry, process
cleanup and strict service-worker proof preserve existing release protections.

**Live evidence:** Both exact runtime/asset SHA proofs PASS, Worker100%, matching
origins/D1, paired planner/T20true, D1 authority500/no fallback. Three payOS keys
retained. Production checkout secret activation succeeded after proof. Both
callback matrices PASS signed200/invalid401/malformed400/oversized413/unauth401.
Actual production app monthly intent113018856588681 yielded a decoded/CRC-verified
49000VND QR matching visible instructions; providerGET PENDING/amountPaid0.
No transfer, fake paid webhook or direct grant. Owner may perform paid acceptance.
Production readiness HTTP200/config/db/queueOK retains informational
CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY warning; it is not a failed service.

**UI:** Plus was excluded from the shared kitchen shell and deliberately selected
legacy navigation. PR73 fixes authenticated/guest Plus, 5-item nav/top Scan,
scoped white hero headings and route comparison case/trailing-slash consistency.
All actual App routes audited; only intended auth/landing/onboarding/immersive
exceptions remain. Production mobile Plus verified visually with real QR.

**New follow-up:** Guest Home with plannerON calls registered-only current-plan
API and shows a generic403 error. This pre-existing issue also affects production
because planner/T20true is preserved. Separate branch
codex/guest-home-planner-20261012 is correcting the Home/Planner guest boundary
and login CTA without weakening server403. Final source, checks and release
receipts must be recorded after that correction is deployed. Temporary private
credential files remain for final verification; cleanup not yet complete.

# Nine-region production release preparation - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** RELEASE_PREPARATION. Active packet
../backend-upgrade/nine-region-production-release/PLAN.md. User separately
requests production upgrade; protected release/migration authorized. OTP/provider
paid tests remain unauthorized, AI budget USD0. Offline checkpoints0407011d/d8699437
remain preserved. Release branch codex/nine-region-production-release.

**Changes:** Checkout admission has a default-off exact Worker capability;
UI preserves no-key legacy checkout while disabled, keyed requests fail closed.
Recovery reads are disabled without opt-in. PayOS signatures/prices/pending-only
grants unchanged. Scanner workflow moved to a preserved non-executable YAML
candidate pending independent promotion, no protection/check bypass. Added staging
0041 identity/exact-main/ledger/bookmark/constraint certification workflow. Extended
production0041 exact-main/constraint checks and explicit post-media tip without
relaxing catalog/media integrity. 0040 bytes/config/dependencies/deploy unchanged.
See ADR-RELEASE-001 in the release packet.

**Checks/failures:** Verification in progress. First focused run235behavior tests
PASS but new workflow-test quote syntax failed; first fullcheck failed generic
Zod input/output inference. Both fixes applied; new complete gates in progress.
No current-SHA PASS or new live deployment claimed yet. All old receipts retained.

**Database/deployment:** Production last separately verified0c0f9933/ledger40.
0041 rollout must precede app deploy and preserve old-worker coexistence; no
remote mutation/new release executed yet. Environment reviewer vn-taphoanhatung
required; CLI hello-tako. Never change protections or reapply0040.

**Next/limits:** Finish local gates/browser/scanners, protected PR/exact-main CI,
staging0041/deploy/smoke, production0041 and deploy with separate Environment
approvals, then receipt/monitor. All nine external acceptance rows remain
PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE; checkout/security/AI/data/VNext remain dormant as
specified. No real OTP, paid AI or live payment testing. Original checkout
preserved. Historical entries below remain immutable.

**Local verification:** pnpm check PASS: 330 files / 7705 tests,166.03s;
lint/both TypeScript projects/41-migration replay/build PASS. Remote gates
explicitly skipped. Focused migration checks18/18 PASS. Full/prod dependency
audits0. Source scan4865 files: Semgrep/zizmor0; Syft504 declaredcomponents;
Gitleaks raw17/exit1 retained, exact-context17matched/0unresolved. Eleven
protected appliedmigration/provider/grant/price/config/lock/deploy paths exact.
All four baseline failure logs retained: plan-capability expectation, quote
syntax, Zod inference and exact workflow migration-list expectation. Browser
attempts preserve port collision, dev-preview empty document and service-worker
interception bypass/401; final mock tests explicitly block service workers.
Public PWA remains a separate deployed check; no actual OTP/provider/payment call.

**Release scope/next:** checkout admission default OFF and scanner workflow
non-executable candidate; real acceptance remains PENDING_EXTERNAL_EVIDENCE.
Push normal PR and wait exact-head then exact-main CI; staging0041/deploy/smoke
before protected production0041/deploy/monitor. No production mutation yet.


Final local browser acceptance PASS in both modes: Chromium/Firefox/WebKit at
320/1440,12 cases/24screenshots, zero stable axe/overflow/broken/page-errors or
external requests. Default-off calls no recovery API or idempotency header;
opt-in keeps key/reload replacement fence/GET resume. Actual new checkout remains
OFF in staging/production configs. Stable enabled-button opacity resolved the
transient WebKit contrast capture; failed evidence remains retained.

/Users/tunbee27/.codex/worktrees/backend-b00-baseline/frigo. This documentation
checkpoint records the verified release source; it is not a new runtime release.

**Delivered/evidence:** Backend integration, Brand V3, Tailwind 4.3.3 compatibility,
strict OTP recovery and exact-main migration fences are on production. PR68
preserves only the unchanged complete D1 authority, with verified 22 source blobs. Main CI
38208731783 PASS. Local/hosted suite 320 files / 7650 tests PASS; 94 isolated

Protected payment/billing sources are unchanged. Synthetic invoice/fridge
fixtures remain TEST_ONLY. Earlier failed attempts remain recorded.

**Database/deployment:** Staging migration 38204668457 and deploy 38209289078 PASS;

Migration source/schema bytes are unchanged in the new deployed SHA.
Actual GitHub approvals for BOTH production runs: vn-taphoanhatung; protections
unchanged. D1 ledger 39 -> 40, only 0040 applied; FK [], quick_check ok, aggregate
drift none, six strict OTP tables/two indexes/constraints PASS; private rollback
bookmark retained. Active production Worker 820c79ef-2db1-4016-95e8-afad9d61958f, 100% traffic;

**Deployed checks:** Staging and production each pass 30 read-only checks, including
18 Chromium/Firefox/WebKit public page cases at 320/1440, exact brand bytes,
unauthenticated tenant guards, release-specific PWA cache upgrade and offline shell.
Production monitoring: 11 observations across 301.163s,
all exact-SHA database/queue/catalog/configuration checks PASS. Runtime status is
`degraded` solely for CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_D1_AUTHORITY, the deliberate complete
D1 cutover warning; no other issue was accepted. These are bounded
observations, not a seven-day SLO certificate. Routed WebKit empty-response failures
and controls retained. New staging smoke1 image timeout and smoke2 undefined
callback failure are retained; smoke3 passes. Exact transport cause unconfirmed.

**Limits/next:** Direct production WebKit Turnstile iframe errors remain recorded;
rendering smoke does not certify challenge solve/authentication. Real inbox delivery remains unverified (deliveryVerified=false);
live OCR/provider accuracy/budget, independent ingredient/data acceptance, physical
old devices/browser floor, protected billing acceptance and load/chaos/SLO remain
open. Dormant provider/V3 writer/Ingredient V2 candidates remain unpromoted. Use
final-local-completion/release-receipt.json, RESULT.md and validation.json for run
links, receipt hashes, recovery instructions and actual scope. No paid calls/mail/
financial transactions were made. Original checkout unchanged. Next work requires
the specific missing provider/data/owner inputs in OPEN_ACCEPTANCE.md.

# Production catalog continuity preflight fix - 2026-10-12 JST

**Task/status:** FIX_IMPLEMENTED_LOCAL_FULL_VALIDATED; normal PR/main CI and a new

6bc1fe96527bf111958b870f66b47f4e0c5ea2fd CI38204233535 PASS.

**Failure/source:** Approved deploy38206476316 FAILED during transition preflight
before recovery upload/application upload/traffic change. Current production remains

requires new application SHAs to reset D1 rollout to shadow, despite unchanged fully
verified catalog authority. Failed run/approval/receipt retained privately.

**Change:** ADR-CATALOG-CONTINUITY-003 narrows production d1->d1 continuity to a
complete healthy protected authority proof, active previous100% version, canonical
binding/flags/commit, ancestor source, identical22catalog kernel/dependency blobs
and unchanged Zod specifier/resolution/integrity. Trusted workflow supplies the
version evidence; no input bypass. Canary/source/catalog drift remains rejected.
Previous authority proof is retained only for bounded edge convergence retries;
old-SHA responses are never final deployment evidence. Runtime/catalog/payment

Legacy auth still invalidates on false and clears resend KV cooldown; across-request

with canonical local TMPDIR and 2 workers, no waiver. Types/full lint/local migration
smoke and both paired-flags builds PASS; focused brand 6 files / 68 tests PASS.
Production-build E2E 82 PASS / 4 failures: baseline ambiguous status selector H and
source-import instrumentation E unsupported in production, both repeated on baseline.
Auth resend/expiry 8 PASS. BEFORE 198 / AFTER 198 renders across 320..1440, zero final axe/
overflow/broken images/navigation clipping; supplemental 15 states / 2 journeys, 12 Week-off,
3 PWA checks PASS. Performance 3 cold/warm pairs / 3 routes, font transfer reduced, JS bundle
near unchanged, CLS Home~0.01765, zero measured domain writes/inventory unchanged.

**Failure disclosure:** Earlier full test run hit /var-vs-/private/var, missing
historical Git blobs and existing Wrangler 5s timeout; environment repaired and full
passed. Default dev preview bootstrap failed before app; production alternative
used real local cookie/Worker. Dependency audit existing 16 high / 2 critical, no package
changes; needs separate remediation. Heuristic UX script advisory FAIL; changed UI
manually checked against guidelines and dynamic a11y evidence. Not field CWV/device/
real Google login/email delivery/provider payment/native/screen-reader certification.

**Database/deployment:** Only synthetic in-memory local fixture mutations. No
remote credentials/secrets/migrations/deploy/production mutation or approval bypass.

**Next:** Review PR with actual final hosted CI, resolve baseline test/dependency
issues in scoped tasks, then owner-authorized staging/cache/device verification.
Do not infer production release authorization from local checks. Preserve other
open operational-doc PR histories when merging the prepend entries.

**Actual changes:** WeekWorkspace dùng nhận diện UI07; board hai cột/stacked,

Setup bốn bước thực sự, 1-3 priorities, quay lại giữ chọn, review/generate tường

theo trong phiên, không hứa lưu bền vững hay thay plan hiện tại; bỏ timer.
Dashboard đưa về setup để xem lại; generation giữ null unlimited/undefined default.
Generation effect AST giữ ngoài mapping ngân sách; App.tsx byte-identical.
Meal/summary ghi rõ projection, unknown và empty. Swap/export có native controls,
focus trap/Escape/return, scroll/safe areas và reduced motion. Clipboard chờ kết
quả thật, phản hồi an toàn, xử lý share cancel và bỏ receipt đã rời dialog; giữ

# UI08 — Hồ sơ và luồng bắt đầu đã kiểm chứng local — 2026-10-10 JST

**Task/status:** `UI08_LOCAL_VERIFIED_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Packet
`docs/ai/tasks/UI08-account-entry.md`, ADR-051. Hoàn tất phạm vi local account,
settings/inbox và entry/onboarding; toàn hệ thống/owner/device/release chưa xong.

**Repository/source:** Canonical `vn-tak/Tako-san`, ID1385308553; checkout

`5ad78191295fabe4a8b2accd14e134452e203788` verified against Git objects: 95 source hashes and
137 evidence payloads match the committed tree and worktree. Manifest SHA256
`ed8d92de9d00fc901b76f338ab145f98365f1deed7754407344b6ad5b4b831b7` matches too.
This documentation checkpoint follows the implementation; it does not contain
its own commit hash. Checkout Frigo cũ giữ nguyên.

**Actual changes:** AccountPage ghép kitchen header/heading vào một cột800px.

UI07 font/assets/tokens; mobile/tablet header và desktop sidebar giữ một lockup.
Landing kể scan→review→inventory→meal, bỏ instant/accuracy guarantees và mascot
fridge cũ; auth shell/field presentation, three onboarding steps và route fallback
cùng identity. Reuse assets/fonts, không thêm pose/dependency. Copy unavailable
family/export/delete và privacy ảnh nói đúng khả năng, không kể API nội bộ.
Notification toggles là local saved intent chưa có consumer/delivery/filter;
validate boolean, owner key giữ và storage failure được nói rõ. Inbox empty không
khẳng định server rỗng khi offline. Cache clear có busy/success/error, không xóa
outbox/local data. Preferences lock lúc lưu, focus lỗi, clear success khi edit;
size7 hiển thị5+ nhưng payload giữ7. App completed-onboarding guard giữ primaryGoal
week để không đè finish vềHome; /week/setup→/planner/new khi flagon, flagoff giữWeek.

hẹp chuyển input/unit và +/- thành hai hàng để số không bị ép khi phóng chữ.

Immutable payload/key từ confirm đầu, single flight, uncertain retry cùng yêu cầu;

Documentation checkpoint theo sau; checkout Frigo cũ giữ nguyên.

**Actual changes:** Scan → review → sửa → explicit confirm → inventory dùng cùng
ReviewHeading/Summary, ReviewFields, source preview gắn đúng scan ID và responsive
kitchen-scan CSS. Pine/coral/warm canvas và Be Vietnam Pro giữ identity prototype;
camera workspace riêng, review có navigation. Desktop hai cột, mobile một cột,
input16px/48px, 8 đơn vị, short viewport dùng action trong document flow. Camera
fallback thư viện, tips details và chọn ảnh khác sau lỗi. Không còn timer giả
queue/AI/validation; upload đang gửi, pending/processing theo DTO. Reduced motion
và status announcement không đọc elapsed mỗi giây.

Accepted fields kiểm tra tên/lượng hữu hạn >0≤10000/ngày trước programmatic submit;
blank không thành0/1. Dòng photo rejected disabled và gửi ID+rejected để server giữ
evidence gốc. Offline synthetic import bỏ rejected, validate toàn bộ accepted
quantity trước mutation, import0 không báo pendingSync, giữ expiryEstimated và
UNKNOWN/KNOWN/ESTIMATED projection.
Photo pendingSync có feedback, khóa sửa/confirm; rời review xóa queued ready draft
trong đúng session/scan, quay lại hydrate trạng thái máy chủ. Camera effect dừng
đúng stream và late response; đổi mode/new image hủy image read, reset input cho
chọn lại cùng file. Source ảnh chỉ memory và bind đúng ID từ upload response;
không tự nhận ảnh cũ khi hydrate. Receipt ingredient lookup đúng rawName/canonical.
Raw AI/OCR, confidence0/unknown, giá/ngày mua, quota/retry, ownership/session,
conflict/refetch, inventory revisions/idempotency và Week shortcut giữ contract.

credential changes. Remote gates skipped; không push/PR/merge/deploy. Own preview
PID92179 đã dừng trước full gate cuối; không còn preview do milestone này giữ.
Canonical remap picker chưa xây: normalizer có thể giữ mapping scan cũ nếu tên mới
không khớp, giới hạn này ghi rõ; source image chưa persist. Chưa physical camera,
Safari/OS keyboard/actual zoom/screen-reader/usability/CWV/provider accuracy QA.
Brand kit và media content chưa final; local gates không chứng nhận production.

**Next action:** UI05: đọc cooking/preparation/complete source, lập packet+ADR và

# T20 fixture staging: sửa tương thích timestamp trước rollout — 2026-10-09 JST

**Task/status:** `T20_STAGING_CERTIFICATION_REQUIRED` /
`T20_PRODUCTION_READINESS_BLOCKED`. PR61 đã merge theo operator continuation;
phát hiện blocker ở công cụ certification trước khi dispatch fixture hoặc deploy.

Main CI `37851106419` SUCCESS, 259files/6361tests; CI green vẫn bỏ sót
fixture defect dưới đây. Nhánh sửa riêng `codex/t20-fixture-schema-contract`.

**Finding/fix:** P1 staging certification: fixture SQL dùng `datetime('now')`,
vi phạm CHECK `updated_at IS strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', updated_at)` của
migration0021. Test cũ dùng bảng tối giản không có CHECK nên bỏ sót.
Sửa đúng một expression thành UTC ISO `strftime(..., 'now')`; không đổi migration,
policy values, bindings, workflow guards, auth/runtime hoặc production data.
Thêm4 regression chạy prepare/audit với full migration chain bằng SqliteD1,
kiểm chứng timestamp, stored policy, insert1, audit0, duplicate prepare reject,
stock/event snapshot không đổi và FK check. Auth records trong tests chỉ là local
SQLite fixtures; workflow remote vẫn chỉ nhận normally registered verified owner.

# Production scan telemetry recovered; bounded validation repair candidate - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout remains INCOMPLETE. Frozen deployed source/main
is `0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`; shadow Worker
`f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b` remains shadow/0%/cutover false,
global static, T20 false. Migration 37689543237 APPLIED only0039 and certification
37693128721 PASS. No canary dispatched; never replay0039 or recovery37536969564.
Operator excludes user-data retention certification because no real users exist.

**Confirmed telemetry:** The operator completed separately scoped Cloudflare API
MCP OAuth, including telemetry-query permission. Bounded `dry=true` queries retrieved
four scan events and seven events from the same invocation, verified against account
hash, Worker version, service, 50-second window, support hash `b6db841cbed9`, request
and trace IDs. OCR attempts1/2 on qwen-vl-ocr each returned SCHEMA_VALIDATION,
611 output tokens; escalation attempt3 on qwen3.8-flash returned INVALID_RESPONSE,
2 output tokens. This supersedes the previous log-access blocker. Schema fields and
escalation parsing branch were not logged; equal token counts do not prove equal
content. The original scan/fixture bytes remain missing and the scan was not replayed.

**Candidate changes:** On `codex/ai-scan-validation-diagnostics`, propagate only
fixed schema field paths and Zod codes (deduplicated, maximum8) into existing bounded
scan repair feedback and `ai_usage`; emit fixed invalid-envelope/empty-content/
unparseable-content/empty-items stages. Revalidate the diagnostic allowlist at Worker
logging. Unknown field names, item indexes, Zod messages/received values and raw
provider content are excluded. Public error codes, validation/quality gates, provider
models, token/call limits, queue fencing, payments and auth are unchanged. This fixes
lost actionable schema feedback and missing diagnostic precision, not a proved live
receipt-schema root cause. No live provider success is claimed.

**Checks:** Initial regression import failed before module creation; with a no-op
module, all6 regression assertions failed as expected. Initial focused6files/87tests
PASS. Final focused9files/109tests PASS4.75s, including adversarial log redaction,
bounded/deduplicated paths, repair prompts, provider stages and queue retry/fencing.
Final `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, migration smoke and build PASS. Full suite
with Node24/TMPDIR=/private/tmp/CI=true/maxWorkers2:255files PASS/1failed,
6315tests PASS/1failed348.06s; the unchanged local Wrangler staging-startup test
exceeded its5s timeout. Isolated unchanged rerun32/32PASS3.31s, actual Wrangler
case1099ms. No full local PASS is claimed. Source/release self-review found no
remaining concrete issue; it is not independent review. Public provider success
still requires new-release validation. Implementation checkpoint `648dbd32010363712f219d25ca0b5109db37c3d3`.
No production write, Worker change or new scan occurred in this diagnostic continuation.

**Checkpoint/source:** Detailed evidence and continuation:
[Production shadow diagnostic](scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).
The former documentation checkpoint is `a29af19`; credentials/raw telemetry remain
ignored under `.wrangler/production-evidence/20261008`. Do not publish raw logs,
account IDs, receipt data or OAuth tokens. R2 bytes and email delivery remain unverified.

**Next action:** Finish checks and source review, normal PR/exact-head CI/merge and
exact-main CI, then revalidate the frozen new source through protected deployment
and a distinct non-PII provider validation. Original failed scan must not be replayed.
If validation still fails, use the new correlated diagnostics to isolate a smallest
justified fix. Only a passing provider gate permits production1/5/25/D1, each with
normal independent Environment approval. No review bypass or migration replay.

All preceding checkpoints below are historical.

# Production shadow verified; AI diagnosis blocked on historical logs - 2026-10-08 JST

**Task/status:** Production rollout INCOMPLETE. Frozen release/main is
`0c77720334d7154b25e81d6e6823ab804619adce`, exact-main CI `37686743768`
SUCCESS. Migration `37689543237` APPLIED only 0039; read-only certification
`37693128721` PASS; production shadow `37763248411` SUCCESS. Each received
normal independent Environment approval by `vn-taphoanhatung`. No canary run
has been dispatched. T20 server/UI remain false; user-data retention certification
is excluded by the operator's instruction.

**Actual production:** Worker `f9c44422-4667-41bf-835e-51d5ce12787b`, deployment
`7f2f522f-c9cf-4762-9022-3435ae7e6e38`, shadow/0%/cutover false/global static.
Schema 39, 500 hydrated recipes, zero hydration failures, 500 valid ready media;
FK clean and quick_check ok. Three new public readiness/service-worker pairs
PASS through `2026-10-08T11:48:52.379Z`: exact source/assets, healthy DB/queue,
config OK, no fallback. Shadow's hosted gates passed 255 files / 6309 tests
(438.75s). Email delivery and current R2 object bytes remain unverified.

**AI blocker:** One synthetic scan on this shadow release was accepted 202 and
ended FAILED / INVALID_RESPONSE / queue attempt 1 / max 3 / items 0, support hash
`b6db841cbed9`, at 10:41:55-10:42:33 UTC (19:41:55-19:42:33 JST). Logout was 200.
Its original fixture/receipt bytes disappeared during session interruption.
Recovered conversation history is explicitly labelled and cannot certify original
receipt bytes or accuracy. Do not resubmit this scan. No confirmed live root cause
or new AI behavior change: malformed envelope, empty content, unparseable content
and empty items can share this code; queue attempt 1 can include multiple provider
calls. Historical `ai_usage` and `scan_terminal` are needed before selecting a fix.

**Recovery/checks:** Re-downloaded all six GitHub candidate/receipt ZIPs; verified
API digests, archive provenance, exact extracted JSON bytes, run/attempt/SHA/CI,
normal approvals, and cross-receipt catalog/media/ledger/Worker invariants.
Account identity matched the certified hash after successful restricted CLI login.
One bounded historical log query (frigo only, 50 seconds, dry=true) was rejected
HTTP 403 / API 10000. Official endpoint requires Workers Observability Write;
OAuth has only account:read/workers_tail:read/offline_access. No scope expansion,
new provider submission, database write, Worker change or Environment bypass.
Original operator wrappers/control receipts and staging private packet are missing;
previous observations remain historical, not newly reverified executable evidence.

**Checkpoint/source:** This documentation stays on `codex/post-media-rollout-evidence`,
separate from frozen production main. Implementation remains reviewed `df2347ca`,
merged via PR58/main `0c777203`. Previous local test/hash-pin and concurrent build
failures are preserved below; no new full local suite is claimed for this docs edit.
Detailed digests, executed recovery commands and restart instructions:
[Production shadow diagnostic](scan/PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DIAGNOSTIC_20261008.md).

**Next action:** Obtain sanitized historical `ai_usage` + matching `scan_terminal`
metadata via Cloudflare Logs for the window above. The restricted CLI received 403;
operator was asked to provide metadata, without credentials or receipt content.
Then isolate the cause, add a meaningful regression and the smallest justified fix,
normal review/CI/merge and validation of any changed final source before a distinct
provider validation. Promote 1/5/25/D1 only after the provider gate passes. Never

# Post-media gate implementation and verification - 2026-10-08 JST

**State:** Implementationdf2347caf414537c287e11defae0b87f8377cec7/tree
7350e86740d246ace03ddb0bd86de522025d03d5 exactly matches independent reviewed
complete tree. Draft PR58 is open. Production remains old healthy static136cb6ff;
ledger38/0038 and recoveryAPPLIED. No production mutation/deploy/provider scan.

**Changes:** Complete0038/0039 catalogs require19 safe aggregates, valid active
hero coverage and actual domain metadata; historical pending-only gates remain.
Generic verification and 0039 preflight validate immutable0035 schema definitions.
The preflight privately reads all18media columns, validates actual rows through
the real mapper/auditor and recomputes coverage/uniqueness. It binds the rowcount
and full metadata/schema SHA256 before migration; post0039 must preserve them.
Only aggregate counts/digests are uploaded. No runtime/config/applied migration,
dependency/credential/Environment policy or protected payment/auth change.

**Review:** Two independent reviews report no remaining concrete blocker after
fixing stale aggregate acceptance of a newly invalid private row. Source review
and actual CLI controls PASS. This proves persisted metadata and observed
non-atomic preservation, not fresh R2 bytes. ADR042 records these limits.

**Executed checks:** Node24 focused5files/98tests PASS40.23s; core migration114/114

SHA256 pin for d1-readonly-query.mjs; adding two reviewed fixed singleSELECT modes
changes that fingerprint. Independent execution-path review confirms unchanged
schema/catalog/runtime behavior and mutation guards. The pin is intentionally
updated to reviewed9d43f62c25561423c6b4c00d611a262a82387dce724c6756274d1db9cfc4deb3;

No assertion or mutation guard is removed; full local PASS is not claimed.

**Build:** An initial build run during active Vite loaders failed the existing
service-worker token guard; retained log records that failure. After all test/CLI
loaders exited, the exact same build command PASS serially without source changes.
Concurrent output mutation is the observed limitation, not an application repair.

**Next:** Complete repin safety checks, final documentation/tree review and
final-head PR58 hosted CI. Merge normally only after green CI, prove reviewed/main
tree equality and exact-main CI, freeze final source. Full final-source staging
shadow/1/5/25/D1, guarded0039 and protected production certification precede
T20=false production shadow, one synthetic scan and1/5/25/D1. Each production
run requires normal independent Environment review. Production release incomplete.

# Post-media migration gate repair - 2026-10-08 JST

**State:** Production release is incomplete. Normally approved read-only diagnostic
37681758263 completed with an intentional catalog gate rejection. Independent
actual artifact/API audit PASS: five ZIP digests and extracted bytes, exact main
282e564faaa7c608fa5617f65bb48d453d8e2fcd, successful CI37680537546 and normal
reviewer vn-taphoanhatung. The final main fence and sanitized uploads succeeded.
No production mutation occurred. Ledger remains38/0038; recovery37536969564 is
APPLIED and must not be replayed.

**Confirmed cause:** Runtime PASS proves500 recipes,0 hydration failures and
fingerprint f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37.
Catalog order0..499, IDs/slugs, provenance, ingredient/step/order coverage and
repeat-capture stability PASS. The old gate rejects media_ready=500 and
recipes_without_pending_hero=500 because it encodes the historical pre-media
rollout condition. These counts do not yet prove per-recipe ready hero coverage,
valid metadata or current R2 bytes. The earlier missing-pending hypothesis is
superseded by this actual evidence; no ready media reset/delete is authorized.

**Decision:** ADR-042 preserves historical pending-only seed/catchup gates and
adds fail-closed operational media checks only for complete0038/0039 catalogs.
Require active hero coverage, closed vocabulary/identity/version, exact ready
key/MIME/dimensions/hash/length, no orphan or duplicate ready role. Guarded0039
must preserve a private ordered full metadata capture by count/SHA256 across the
additive migration. Receipts publish only aggregate counts/hashes. This is metadata
and preservation proof, not a fresh R2 object-byte verification.

**Staging:** Source282e shadow37681762795 and canary1%37682153382 SUCCESS,

**Prior production diagnosis:** Normally approved37616546408 SUCCESS proves500

rows and stable observed non-atomic snapshots at ledger38/0038. It does not prove
live full runtime fingerprint, complete ordered IDs/slugs or pending hero/media
invariants. Missing0039 in that diagnostic's baseline is expected and does not
explain the preflight failure of migration37615237481. Recovery is alreadyAPPLIED;
no replay, blind migration retry or rollback followed.

**Implementation:** Reviewed3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d adds sanitized
read-only preflight diagnostics with unchanged catalog/runtime verifiers, complete
38-prefix ledger fencing, repeated successful snapshots and fixed error enums.
Failed queries cannot reuse stale JSON. Only safe aggregates/counts/hashes are
published. The final main fence executes after rejected diagnosis. Runtime,
config, migrations, credentials, dependencies and Environment policy are unchanged.

**Local investigation:** The exact historical recovery plan was recompiled from
a8fa0324bb609274cc07a5c4b079e7ee4633fd83 with original SQL SHA
e5a58960baa4b8e1f4cae8be94985dd03cf4e9acf03c274b38fb310ce79f28c0.
Four local controls PASS: recovery preserves recipe_media, so missing/duplicate
pending heroes can survive an APPLIED V1 catalog with500hydrated recipes and exact
runtime fingerprint while verifyCatalogAtTip rejects it. Runtime order is restored
from1000..1499 to0..499 by the same plan. This is a source/local hypothesis only;
live media state still requires the new protected read-only diagnostic.

# Catalog preflight diagnostic implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Production diagnostic
37616546408 completed SUCCESS at 2026-10-07T12:17:44Z on main
969d1d3735b85913c9b1dfe6ae4df2eba40e98b6 with normal independent approval by
vn-taphoanhatung. Five actual artifact ZIP digests and extracted JSON bytes PASS
in independent audit. Ledger stays 38 / 0038; 500 physical and hydrated recipes,
0 hydration failures, 2702 ingredients and matching order rows, exact historical
V1 ingredient lines/positions and stable observed non-atomic snapshots are proven.
The missing 0039 diagnostic baseline is expected and does not explain migration
37615237481's catalog preflight failure. T21R-B fingerprintVerified proves the
target V1 source, not the live full runtime fingerprint. Live ordered IDs/slugs,
media invariants and full runtime fingerprint remain unproven. Recovery is already
APPLIED; no recovery replay, blind migration retry or rollback is justified.

**Changes:** Implementation 3d043ec9156841b7f6b0e5b3a7068670b40c932d, tree
c79bda74d06d7b0637eb034b3057e2df1eecf636, adds a read-only catalog preflight
receipt to the existing protected diagnostic workflow. The helper reuses unchanged
verifyCatalogAtTip and verifyRuntimeCatalogContent at exact ledger 38, requires
repeat successful catalog/runtime captures and an unchanged complete ledger, and
reports independent PASS/REJECTED/NOT_EVALUATED checks. Only 13 numeric/null
aggregates, counts, hashes and fixed reason enums are uploaded; raw rows and
exception messages stay private. Failed captures cannot reuse stale JSON. Stable
non-atomic consistency is claimed only when ledger and both snapshot comparisons
PASS. The final main fence runs even after a rejected diagnostic. No production
write, runtime/migration/config/dependency or Environment-policy change.

**Verification:** Final helper tests 38/38 PASS under Node 24.16; final exact
Node 22.23.3 focused tests 3 files / 58 tests PASS (35.73s). Independent final
review of implementation/tree reports no remaining finding. Actual CLI controls
7/7 and exact workflow-shell stale JSON/provider-failure controls 5/5 PASS, with
0 production calls; official Node 22 CLI controls 4/4 PASS. Final lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, script
syntax, actionlint 1.7.12 and diff checks PASS. Default local full suite returned 3 failed
files / 12 failed / 6186 passed (179.65s): untouched capture tests compare
uncanonical macOS /var temp paths with real /private/var paths, and the local
Wrangler prefix test timed out under default concurrent workers. No tests were
weakened. Independent focused3files/125tests PASS4.58s with canonical TMPDIR
and maxWorkers=2; the two capture files reproduce the same11 failures with the
uncanonical default TMPDIR even with two workers. All eight involved source/test
files are byte-identical between969d and the implementation. Exact resource
bottleneck of the concurrency-sensitive Wrangler timeout was not profiled. Full
canonical-TMPDIR/maxWorkers=2 regression completed 253 passed / 1 failed files,
6197 passed / 1 failed tests (328.71s). The remaining unchanged local Wrangler
catchup test took33.993s and timed out at its existing5s bound; it passed1.745s
in focused verification. All new38tests passed in both full runs. Draft PR57
CI37624949372 is pending; no local full-suite PASS is claimed.
One actionlint invocation used a nonexistent certify filename; corrected to the
actual production-certify.yml and all four affected release workflows PASS.

**Production:** Public readiness at 2026-10-07T12:53:19.214Z remains healthy old
Worker 136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f / static / 0% / cutover false,

not apply 0039 or upload a Worker. No recovery replay or catalog rollback followed.
Both candidate/receipt artifact ZIP digests and extracted manifest bytes PASS in

Main remains5b12ab71acd84beec62be967c950b12d596c88d7 while the small fix is reviewed.

**Change:** Branch codex/migration-gate-toolchain adds pinned pnpm setup10 and
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile before the production migration gate. The already
locked TypeScript dependency is now available on a fresh runner. No package,
lockfile, runtime, migration, production credentials or Environment policy changes.
Other deploy/certify source gates import only Node built-ins and do not share the
failure. This supersedes the previous checkpoint's next action to use unchanged
5b12 migration tooling.

**Verification:** actionlint1.7.12 and git diff --check PASS. Node24.16 focused

fresh checkout reproduced missing TypeScript before dependency install. Frozen
install completed, module import and offline candidate proof then PASS with the
explicit tested origin/main SHA:only0039,34pinned hashes. The initial local clone
inherited a different main ref and its ancestry check failed; that fixture ref was
corrected only in the private temporary clone, then the candidate check passed.

# Import confirmation implementation - 2026-10-07 JST

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. Recovery37536969564 was normally
approved and has ATTEMPTED_COMPLETION_UNCONFIRMED at BOOKMARK_AND_IMPORT, without
importFailure or provider code. This supersedes any earlier claim that all incidents
are absent; its exact namespace has not yet been inspected remotely. No subsequent
retry/rollback/0039/application deployment has occurred.

**Changes:** Branch codex/production-import-json-confirmation adds a strict pinned
Wrangler file-import stdout parser and a third sealed SELECT-only inspector for
37536969564/a8fa. Historical incident definitions and compiler bytes are preserved.
The runner saves and repeats the third capture, and requires absent/stable/all-eight
primary guards/no failed reads before any future restore pin/bookmark/import. Query
JSON remains strict. Unknown completion retains sanitized OUTPUT_UNCONFIRMED and
never starts an automatic rollback. Marker observations are not full catalog
certification or provider-terminal evidence; UNKNOWN_NO_CURSOR/retryAuthorized=false
remain explicit. No runtime, migration, payment/auth or Environment policy change.

**Evidence:** Root independently reproduced the third plan receipt exactly against
the retained production artifact:296/36 statements and both SQL hashes PASS.
Implementation checkpoint244a43b includes the final reviewed source. Root final
runner/auth/parser focused3files/194tests PASS36.51s (runner75/auth13/parser106);
inspector163/163 PASS44.27s. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, actionlint1.7.12,
script syntax and diff checks PASS. Both independent reviews report no remaining
blocker after tightening contradictory optional metadata. The first exploratory
full suite was deliberately stopped(exit143) for that final code/test change;
it is not claimed PASS or a regression failure. Full final-source suite PASS:
253files/6160tests,341.60s,Node24.16,maxWorkers2. Hosted final-head/main CI remains pending.
Inspector's first focused attempt had one fixture-only rollback guard failure; it
was corrected by separating drift and real rollback cases, then163/163 PASS.
No live database completion follows from these local tests.

**Next:** Finish parser tightening, full gates and independent final review; publish
and merge a normal PR, require exact-main CI and dispatch one protected inspect-import
with its final reviewed implementation head. Obtain normal vn-taphoanhatung review,
retain sanitized evidence and choose action from the actual third incident. Applied
requires independent complete V1/provenance/runtime proof before0039; absent requires
all stable guards plus separately reviewed intentional recovery; partial/blocked
requires an incident decision. Re-certify the newly merged source through staging
shadow/1/5/25/D1 T20=true, then guarded0039/full production certification and same-source
production T20=false shadow, one synthetic provider smoke,1/5/25/D1. a8fa staging proof
cannot certify a new source. User-data retention checks remain excluded by operator.

Root and independent reviewer both classify latest observations as ABSENT,

First temporary root verifier incorrectly required zero failed reads in the

verifier explicitly retains those failures and separately requires exact latest

**Credentials:** effectiveAPI_TOKEN/globalKeyPrecedencefalse; ACCOUNT token

identity GETsHTTP200 and SELECT1 primarytrue prove read access. Token metadata
GET403/9109 leaves D1 Edit/account resource/deny/IP/TTL policy UNKNOWN and
writeAuthorizationUNKNOWN. Account-owned tokens officially support D1; pinned
Wrangler3.114.17 uses the same Bearer path for query/import. Token kind alone
is not evidence for prior10000. No credential values were read or published.

**Cloudflare console observation:** existing Chrome session is authenticated to
the same account and frigo-db binding. Named `tako-san-production-deploy` account
token is Active, recently used, and the account-policy D1 filter shows Read=1,
Edit=0. This is direct policy evidence for that named deployment token; the
aggregate receipt intentionally contains no token identifier, so name/activity
correlation is not an exact secret-to-token identity proof. No permissions were
changed at this initial observation. User then explicitly confirmed adding only
D1 Edit. Existing token policy was saved once:13 permissions versus12 before,
D1 Read retained and D1 Write added. Reopening the persisted token verifies
Read=1/Edit=1/Active. Existing entire-account resource, no expiry and all-IP policy
are unchanged; no other permission, token rotation, secret value or GitHub secret
was changed. The current receipt's writeAuthorization remains UNKNOWN; console
name/activity correlation is not an exact secret mapping or HTTP write certificate.

under --json/loggerLevelerror. Full stdoutJSON.parse fails; --command query control
is cleanJSON. Runner's file-import parser therefore rejects legitimate successful

**State:** Production release remains incomplete. User authorizes recovery,
migration and deployment and confirms no real users; user-data retention
certification is excluded. Normal independent production Environment review
remains required. Current main is 660521b41cd0a71e1d2ce88806e2b7d041b30155.

re-proves original static100% Worker/ledger before and after and compares two
aggregate captures. No SQL file import, pin, rollback or migration path runs.
Existing normal independent Environment approval/full-reviewed-tree/CI gates
remain. Hypotheses about protected internal-table PRAGMA or completion parsing
are unproved; recovery compiler and mutation behavior are unchanged.

Recovery37384670328 lost import completion after this pin/bookmark; no automatic
rollback or post-import certification ran. Exact repair objects and provider
blocking status still need inspection. Cloudflare import poll requires the lost
at_bookmark; Time Travel bookmark is not an equivalent cursor. Successful primary
SELECTs can prove no blocking import at observation times, not a terminal reason.

**Next:** Finish bounded helper/tests/full repository gates and independent
review; publish PR, final-head CI, normal merge and exact-main CI. Dispatch one

invalid or >=100MiB metadata stops before Worker inspection/pin/bookmark/import.
Cloudflare query metadata documents database bytes; pinned Wrangler3.114.17
retains this metadata. Actual production metadata availability is still unproven.
Worker executable ca91a1f accepts observed bounded annotations/AI project/runtime
assets. Full asset runtime equivalence is checked before traffic and after deploy;
unknown fields and changed behavior remain rejected.

**Staging:** Exactb33/T20true completed shadow37379785022, canary1 37380051888,
canary5 37380383487, canary25 37380656192, D1 37381006320. All succeeded with

A changed release must restart shadow with intentional catalog rollback=true.

**Checks/failures:** Capacity regression red16failed/4passed; green20/20PASS,

and diff PASS. Initial concurrent build failed with missing Service Worker build
token; standalone pnpm build passed (no source change). Cause is unproven; serialize
build with tests. Observed metadata regression red11fail/40pass; green51/51PASS and independent
rerun. Final lint/typecheck/migration smoke/syntax/diff PASS; independent reviews
find no blockers. Initial capacity-only fullsuite intentionally cancelled exit130
after26 files/1593 tests because the real inspect required another source fix;
that is not a full PASS. Frozen final candidate fullsuite is running; build follows
serially. Hosted final-head and exact merged-main CI remain required.

**Next:** Complete full local validation and the serial build, require green
final-head hosted PR CI, merge with a merge commit, then
require green exact-main CI and freeze main. Bind new restore-v1 attempt1 to that
main and its final PR head (ancestor/different SHA/identical complete tree), obtain
fresh normal production approval. Require V1_CATALOG_CERTIFIED_STATIC/ledger38/

# Production replacement candidate checkpoint - 2026-10-06 JST

State: production release incomplete. Current main remains
`cd66bb86ca7c440b606fb8672e89428800df33c2`. PR49 carries AI correction `e7d7db1`
and Worker metadata compatibility correction `1ed5733`. The operator authorizes
production release and confirms no real users; user-data preservation certification
is excluded.

Changes: static-pin now accepts Cloudflare's documented informational metadata
`hasPreview` and `modified_on` alongside legacy `has_preview`. Unknown fields
still fail before mutation. Exact deployed source/runtime/bindings/assets,
module equivalence and approval/freshness fences remain enforced. AI repair
preserves the complete default/custom extraction task/schema; its role in the
observed live INVALID_RESPONSE remains unproven.

Checks: metadata regression red 3 failures / 20 passes; final focused suite
24 PASS, independently rerun. Combined recovery/AI targeted validation five files /
70 PASS. Lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production build, syntax and diff PASS.
Full combined candidate suite: 249 files / 5653 PASS, exit 0, 514.45s,
unchanged timeouts, one worker, UTC and canonical macOS temp path.

Remote: recovery37334212154 intentionally CANCELLED at 2026-10-05T20:49:15Z,
recover job steps empty, approvals/pending deployments empty. It executed no
Worker/catalog/migration mutation and no longer requires review. Staging canary1
37370418398 FAILURE before steps; annotation: "The job was not acquired by Runner
of type hosted even after multiple attempts". Staging remains healthy shadow
on cd66/T20true; production remains old 136cb6ff/static fallback/ledger38. Actual
catalog recovery,0039 and new production application deployment remain pending.
The earlier normal disposable guest/synthetic scan failed INVALID_RESPONSE;
logout revoked its session. Corrected live provider readiness is still unproven.

External gate: GitHub Actions incident remains active; latest 20:47:22Z update
reports degraded availability. PR49 prior-head CI37371504325 failed before steps at 20:58:30Z with the
same hosted-runner assignment annotation. Final-head hosted CI and exact merged-main
push CI remain required after publication; resolve their current IDs from PR49.

Next: require green hosted CI on the final PR49 head, merge with a merge commit,
require exact-main push CI and freeze the new main. New recovery attempt1 must bind ref to
that main and reviewed_sha to the final merged PR49 head, preserving ancestry
and complete tree equality. Fresh normal production Environment review is needed
only when that new run exists. Require V1_CATALOG_CERTIFIED_STATIC before guarded
0039; full production certification follows 0039. Restage the final SHA through
shadow/1/5/25/D1, paired T20true. Production uses T20false, same immutable SHA,
shadow/live non-PII AI proof before 1/5/25/D1 promotion. Do not reuse the cancelled
run or old reviewed implementation head.

Runner-local final-candidate smoke is prepared at
`/private/tmp/takosan-provider-smoke-final-candidate/live-provider-smoke.py`.
Static syntax and fixture hash PASS; it has not been executed. Require explicit
production SHA and the deployed corrected shadow before its one synthetic scan.

# Production release and AI retry checkpoint - 2026-10-06 JST

Current GitHub main `cd66bb86ca7c440b606fb8672e89428800df33c2` has green exact-main
push CI37333194384:248 files /5640 tests plus lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build.
PR48 is merged. Actions registration375554736 is active; push registration run
37333194265 succeeded with only register running and gate/recover skipped.

Reviewed recovery dispatch37334212154 passed its complete-tree/main/CI gate and
is waiting for normal production Environment review by `vn-taphoanhatung`.
CLI actor `vn-tak` cannot approve it. No production catalog recovery,0039
migration or application deployment has occurred. Do not advance main while
this run is pending: its mutation fences require exact current main.

Staging0039 certification37331557226 and runtime readiness37331892983 succeeded

exact SHA smoke and version223b8b47-5439-49b9-b089-e444e7a97174. Same-SHA canary
progression is in progress; production T20 remains deliberately off.

Actual live non-PII production receipt smoke on old136cb6ff accepted one synthetic

One disposable guest/session/scan was created through normal APIs; logout200
revoked the session. No email/OTP, security bypass or secret extraction.
Provider availability/receipt accuracy remain uncertified. Staging mock does
not prove live provider behavior. Production AI/config and image preprocessing
are unchanged from the deployed Worker in the prior candidate.

Executable AI correction `e7d7db1` preserves the full default/custom extraction
prompt while adding repair feedback on same-model retry and multimodal escalation.
The source bug is independently reproduced: default retry lost task/schema.
It can undermine recovery; its causation of the live failure is unproven.
Regression red4 failed/3 passed; correction and adjacent AI/provider/router
checks5 files/81 PASS. Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff PASS; full local
suite249 files/5647 PASS (513.76s), unchanged timeouts. Independent review finds no blockers; input governance includes
repair feedback and bounds calls. No AI model/provider/quality/security policy
change. Publish as a separate reviewed fix, hold merge while recovery is pending,
then verify real provider behavior before declaring production release complete.

Next: complete normal review of recovery37334212154, inspect aggregate receipt
and any unsupported provider metadata before further operation. Require V1 catalog
certification, then guarded0039. Merge green AI correction only after the pending
recovery completes or is intentionally replaced; stage the final immutable SHA
through shadow/canary/D1 and deploy production through the normal Environment gates.
Report: [PRODUCTION_AI_REPAIR_20261006.md](scan/PRODUCTION_AI_REPAIR_20261006.md).
PR49 is open for the AI correction; no auto-merge and main remainscd66.
Staging canary1 run37370418398 and hosted AI CI37370993436 are queued with no
runner/deploy attempt. GitHub Status confirms an Actions incident affecting
hosted runner assignment/start times (19:11:58UTC start;20:39:27UTC update).
External wait has no ETA; do not redispatch duplicate runs or weaken gates.
Recovery37334212154 still waits for required reviewer; deployment is incomplete.

# Recovery workflow registration checkpoint - 2026-10-05 UTC

Executable recovery `7f59afa`, registration remediation `aea900d`.
PR46 and47 are merged; current main080b78b has green exact-main push CI37330231950.
Full local recheck and hosted recovery CI each pass248 files /5639 tests.

Actual recovery dispatch is blocked before run creation: GitHub Actions workflow
index/web/GET and CLI/REST dispatch return404 for the new dispatch-only recovery
file, despite its presence on default main and valid actionlint schema. No run,
production approval, Worker change or D1 mutation was performed. The provider
registration cause is unresolved; invalid source syntax is not evidenced.

Minimal remediation adds a main-push registration job containing only echo, with
no checkout, production Environment, secret reference or production tool. The
production gate now explicitly requires workflow_dispatch/main/confirmtrue;
recover still depends on that gate and all authorization checks reject push.
Actionlint1.7.12, lint, diff check and13 approval tests PASS; independent review
finds no blockers. Full hosted PR/main CI remains required before dispatch.

Staging0039 certification37331557226 SUCCESS at080b78b: already-present39 ledger,

# Production V1 catalog recovery checkpoint - 2026-10-05 UTC

Executable checkpoint `7f59afa` on `codex/production-v1-recovery` starts from
merged guard PR #45 / main `603c4404bebd53fce711b47c9d5cef9b30ce2bfa`.
Exact-main guard CI [37320114700](https://github.com/vn-tak/Tako-san/actions/runs/37320114700)
succeeded. User confirms no real users; user-data retention certification is
excluded. Source restoration uses certified V1, without assigning ambiguous
positions to the live ingredient population or claiming proven corruption.

Independent implementation reviews found no remaining blockers. The recovery
workflow binds the final merged PR head to the complete exact-main tree and CI,
normal independent production Environment approval and the shared production lock.
It first clones the exact old Worker source/runtime/bindings/assets with only
catalog static/0/cutover=false, then imports one atomic generated catalog batch.
Unknown provider metadata stops before mutation. Lost import response records an
unknown outcome requiring inspection; it never blindly retries or rolls back.
Catalog-only archive rollback requires the unchanged generated target and the
same pinned static Worker. Historical migrations and unrelated tables are intact.

Validation: targeted four suites / 56 tests PASS; lint, typecheck, migration
smoke, production build, syntax and diff checks PASS. Actual local workerd D1
restore and rollback PASS with pinned Wrangler 3.114.17: restore hydrates 500
recipes at fingerprint `f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`,
ledger38/FK0, archive6720; rollback restores6720/order0/FK0. A local compound
SELECT parser limit was reproduced and fixed by using VALUES. Full-suite result
first run: 5638 PASS / one unchanged Wrangler timeout; narrow recheck32 PASS.
Full recheck248 files /5639 PASS (522.82s). Hosted final-head CI
37327411648 also248 /5639 PASS, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build PASS.
PR46 merged at9fbaffa; exact-main push CI is pending before remote execution.

Production still serves the old Worker `136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`
on static fallback, ledger38/0038/order0/hydration0. Remote recovery, migration
and new application deployment counts remain0. Next: merge green recovery PR,
require exact-main CI, run protected recovery and retain aggregate evidence;
then guarded0039, staging and production Deploy with immutable release inputs.

# T21R-C3 dispatch readiness and dependency hardening — 2026-10-03 JST

- [x] Resolve `vn-tak/Tako-san` to stable ID `1385308553`; exact base main
  `0d4fe89b7ccc72e013aafe53665059d0e62bd3b4`, PR36 merged, reviewed head
  `63739c56`, exact-main push CI `37008867187` SUCCESS; isolated C3 branch.
- [x] Verify official upstream version refs, peeled commits and releases;
  pin four Action dependencies / six uses; preserve workflow semantics and CI.
- [x] Reject mutable/tag/branch/short/uppercase refs, appended/job-level actions;
  prove a pin-only delta still fails the existing 73-entry review binding.
- [x] Bind transferred current repository name in gate/receipt; reject former
  authorization names while preserving certified V1 historical target metadata.
- [x] Audit production Environment metadata without mutation: expected reviewer
  present; self-review prevention false, bypass available true, branch policy null.
- [x] Record SELECT-only path separately from UNKNOWN Cloudflare credential
  scope; no Cloudflare introspection, credential provisioning or production read.
- [x] Document future distinct feature/main SHA pair, exact-main CI, attempt 1,
  normal approval, privacy, 0038/0039 boundaries and explicit abort conditions.
- [x] Focused 556/556; guarded AI/local-D1 128/128; full single-worker 230 files /
  5,210 tests / zero skips PASS. Lint/types/local migrations/build/syntax/diff PASS.
  One-line synthetic AI response fixes proven test egress; no assertion weakening.
- [x] Recheck the exact published code checkpoint: C2 4 files / 247 PASS,
  11.39 seconds using existing Vitest after the old scratch pnpm path was absent.
  No dependency, assertion, timeout or test-selection change.
- [x] Resolve publication access: earlier CLI credential unavailable; first workflow
  blob write via `takovn2` returned 403 `Resource not accessible by integration`.
  Earlier connections did not list a `vn-tak` installation. Current `vn-tak`
  profile/owner `335007142`, installation `167341024` and actual writes verified.
  Publish through this connection using normal GitData feature-ref creation,
  preserve original local history and verify exact tree/head equality. Remote
  code checkpoint `e49c60a176cec80593e8b8644d058341cfeca720` has the tested tree.
- [x] Create normal feature ref at that code checkpoint, without force or PR.
- [x] Obtain explicit approval for all five documentation files and destination
  public `vn-tak/Tako-san`: user confirmation on 2026-10-03 JST includes completion
  status updates. Earlier automatic-review metadata rejections are recorded in
  the report; no alternate transport was used to bypass them.
- [x] Publish the approved documentation checkpoint after the tested code SHA
  through a normal feature-ref update. Preserve original local history and
  executable bytes; report final local/remote SHA and tree equality externally.
- [ ] Independently review the final normally published C3 head before opening
  any PR. Then protected merge and exact post-merge current-main push CI.
- [ ] Separately authorized operator capture/risk decision and new normal
  production Environment approval. No production action is authorized by C3.

  `db7728d0203089e8f35897f2fff2f2e35437e026`, failure `T21RC2_LEDGER_CHANGED` in setup.
- [x] Resolve certified-main 0038 blob and exact 39 repository migrations;
  existing helper returns the exact first 38 production names. No ledger drift.
- [x] Reproduce missing historical-object error in an offline throwaway shallow
  clone; full-history helper succeeds. No tests fetch Git or substitute authority.
- [x] CI checkout full history and static regression; other CI/runtime/production

  Exact command list and limitations are in the scoped report.

**Publication/review handoff:** One narrow normal-push commit after `3e1bb60b`,

# Production V2 existing_canonical_id review fail-closed — 2026-09-30

- [x] existing_canonical_id + any review (object or `{}`) has no bridge authority.
- [x] existing_canonical_id + review=null + distinct sourceId still bridges.
- [x] Hostile tests for non-null review, empty review, same-id, null sourceId.
- [ ] Hosted CI on new head; independent approval. Do not merge or dispatch production diagnostics.

---

# Production V2 lineage reviewed-reconciliation contract — 2026-09-30

- [x] Strict reviewed reconciliation: basis + evidenceReference, ING_ENR_ only.
- [x] existing_canonical_id requires non-empty distinct sourceId; null sourceId does not bridge.
- [x] Recipe-id set match is required for authoritative subset.
- [x] Hostile tests: empty/wrong review, wrong ID type, valid reviewed bridge, null sourceId, valid existing, provisional, duplicate_alias, ambiguous/invalid, recipe-id drift, privacy.
- [ ] Hosted CI on new head; independent approval. Do not merge or dispatch production diagnostics.

---

# Production V2 catalog lineage diagnostic remediation — 2026-09-30

- [x] Remove causal overclaim from missing-line metadata; use classified vs causally explained.
- [x] Stop ID-omitting content matches from granting authoritative lineage; provisional reconciliation has no authority.
- [x] Separate relative canonical order from runtime position; detect position holes; `runtimePositionAuthority=false`.
- [x] Add hostile unit tests for the three boundaries and keep artifact privacy.
- [ ] Hosted CI on the remediating head; independent review. Do not merge with unresolved P1. Do not dispatch production diagnostics from this PR.

# Production V2 catalog lineage diagnostic — 2026-09-30

- [x] Verify main `252096cccf602d07d6e33067024c5df2d6ba8a3e` and protected diagnostic `36653466481` (V1 lineage rejected; 6720/0/0 hydrated).
- [x] Add runner-local V2 semantic comparison to the existing read-only production workflow; no extra D1 query.
- [x] Cover exact match, 6720-style subset/missing, production-only, drift, duplicates, ambiguity, normalization, runtime quantity, recipe-id drift, malformed input, CLI privacy.
- [ ] Obtain hosted PR CI and independent review; protected merge; new exact-main CI.
- [ ] Dispatch Environment-approved read-only diagnostics on the new main SHA and inspect the V2 lineage artifact. Keep 0039 and repair STOPPED.

---

# Production catalog lineage diagnostic — 2026-09-30

- [x] Derive historical 0038 baseline locally: 500 recipes, 2,702 ingredient lines and 2,702 explicit positions; compare against protected production aggregate 6,720/0 without assuming why they differ.
- [x] Add runner-local, sanitized V1 ingredient-line comparison to the existing read-only production workflow; leave its remote SELECTs, identity gate and Environment approval unchanged.
- [x] Earlier head `fe1d2e5` passed local full check and hosted CI `36630071407` (221 files / 4,823 tests). Earlier Wrangler-startup timeout attempts and interrupted-worker attempt were not green.
- [x] Open PR #28 from implementation `cd25370`; merge PR #27 into main `e7c74a0` and preserve its STOP packet in this branch.
- [x] Add an actual CLI regression test: it failed before fixing the missing `writeFileSync` import, then focused tests passed 15/15.
- [x] Updated local `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` PASS (typecheck, lint, full Vitest, migration smoke, build); independent read-only diff review found no additional issue.
- [ ] Push resolved merge and obtain new hosted CI and GitHub review for PR #28; only then merge it, obtain new exact-main CI and production Environment approval for a read-only run.
- [ ] Use that receipt to identify V1 exact matches and unresolved rows; prove any V2 lineage and all required positions separately before designing a production repair. Migration 0039 remains STOPPED.

# Production ingredient-order recovery STOP — 2026-09-29

- [x] PR #26 merged as `d0c6702`; exact-main CI `36576510231` SUCCESS; protected read-only run `36577380500` SUCCESS with sanitized diagnostic `BLOCKED`.
- [x] Confirmed 6,720 ingredient rows, zero position rows, 500 affected recipes and 0/500 hydrated; production ledger remains 38/0038.
- [x] Prepared documentation-only STOP packet and passed local `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` (types, lint, tests, migration smoke, build).
- [ ] Prove exact live ingredient identity and reviewed position source per row through a separate read-only gate; determine V1/enrichment/mixed state and investigate regression provenance.
- [ ] Review a separate preflighted, recoverable catalog repair only after all positions are evidenced; then recertify authority. Migration 0039 and rollout remain STOPPED. See `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_INGREDIENT_ORDER_RECOVERY_PACKET.md`.

# Production D1 order-coverage validation — 2026-09-29

- [x] Final `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, 220 files / 4,816 tests, migration smoke and build. Initial unfiltered run had one local Wrangler startup timeout; focused rerun and full rerun passed.
- [ ] Push reviewable follow-up PR, obtain hosted CI and independent review, then protected merge/exact-main CI before another Environment-approved read-only diagnostic.
- [ ] Keep migration 0039 and production rollout blocked until order coverage and fallback cause are proven and recovery is reviewed.

- [x] Environment-approved read-only diagnostic `36572487026` PASS: ledger 38/38 through 0038, missing only 0039; 500 physical recipes, 0 hydrated, 500 `missing_ingredient_position` failures. No production mutation.
- [x] Add count-only order-coverage query to the diagnostic and validate a sanitized aggregate; focused 3-file/71-test suite PASS.
- [ ] Complete full local gates, hosted PR CI and independent review before merging the follow-up. A new main SHA needs new exact-main CI and production Environment approval for another read-only run.
- [ ] Investigate order coverage from the new receipt; prepare a reviewed, recovery-safe catalog repair only after root cause proof. Treat 0039 as a separate migration blocker. No production rollout while fallback persists.

- [x] Fresh public readiness: production still degraded with `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS` fallback; staging still D1/500 with no fallback.
- [x] Match Cloudflare `whoami` account to configured account before the new workflow's first D1 read; focused tests 6/6 PASS.
- [ ] Run full local gates and hosted CI on the updated PR head; obtain independent GitHub review before protected merge.
- [ ] After merge, exact-main CI and production Environment approval precede read-only diagnosis. Migration and deployment stay stopped at the independent ledger/fallback blockers.

# Unified production release train — 2026-09-29

- [x] Fresh production Environment read-only run `36563767379`: Worker/deployment/DB identity verified; ledger lacks `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`; certification stops before recipe rows.
- [x] Create isolated checkout and read-only diagnostic workflow plus sanitized failure-code receipt; correct migration post-apply runtime proof to use guarded SELECTs.
- [x] Prepare `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_0039_MIGRATION_PACKET.md` with exact plan, Time Travel recovery and compatibility/rollback boundaries; no migration dispatched.
- [x] Local gates: lint, typecheck, 305 focused tests, migration smoke, build, final full 220-file/4,812-test suite and diff check PASS. Initial sparse-fixture/typecheck failures and a parallel Wrangler timeout cleared after expanding checkout and rerunning.
- [ ] Review the workflow and packet independently; obtain hosted PR CI and normal protected merge. Any new main SHA invalidates old exact-SHA certification.
- [ ] Dispatch the diagnostic only after merge/exact-main CI and production Environment approval; determine hydration code counts and repair the independent D1 fallback.
- [ ] Recheck the full production ledger and exact Wrangler plan; satisfy every packet precondition before considering 0039 migration. Keep production rollout stopped while fallback or migration mismatch remains.

- [x] Rebuild 500-recipe canonical research source from the original ZIP with
  explicit provisional ingredient identities, source verification state and
  per-recipe runtime exclusion reasons.
- [x] Separate provisional runtime fingerprint from null final release
  fingerprint; derive four typed release blockers and a fail-closed release
  assertion/CLI. Source validation remains independent.
- [x] Local final checks passed and implementation checkpoint `1f77902` is
  committed; source check passes, release check fails with four typed blockers,
  import check and full `pnpm check` pass.
- [x] Push PR #11 at `dea13cd`, update its description and verify hosted CI
  `36268138066` SUCCESS on that exact head (204 files / 4,597 tests).
- [ ] Verify hosted CI on the final documentation receipt head; keep PR open
  for independent review.
- [ ] Hoplite reconciliation of required ingredient loss, reviewed ingredient
  authority, source content and nutrition evidence before final release
  projection, fingerprint, or generated 0040.

## Historical T20 board (unchanged)

**Latest (2026-09-26):** PR #9 merged at `cb22cfb`; exact-main CI green.
Local Cloudflare login and read-only staging D1 name/ID match are now verified;
staging 0039 still awaits the reviewed workflow and its remote gates. The
section below is the live board; older entries are history.

## T20 staging identity and 0039 workflow — live gate, 2026-09-26 UTC

- [x] Main `cb22cfb` exact-head CI `36240577660` validate SUCCESS (202 files /
  4,574 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build). Automatic deploy
  `36240842196` release/staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED; flag-OFF/static
  staging deploy is not T20 certification.
- [x] `git fetch --all --prune`, `git diff --check`, `pnpm check:migrations`
  PASS. Staging migration tooling contract suites: 3 files / 63 tests PASS;
  targeted ESLint PASS. Initial test parser/JSONC failures corrected.
  `pnpm check` PASS (203 files / 4,580 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke,
  build) on `9635ad6`; hosted PR #10 `36241921150` validate SUCCESS.
- [x] Independent review P2 gaps in staging workflow FK cascade check and
  preflight SQL allowlist fixed; 3 files / 63 tests plus targeted ESLint PASS
  after fix. Require exact-head hosted CI on follow-up docs/review-fix commit.
- [x] Owner-approved device OAuth (`pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device
  --browser=false --scopes account:read user:read d1:write`) succeeded without
  changing repo dependencies. `CI=true pnpm exec wrangler whoami` authenticated;
  read-only `wrangler d1 list --json` and `d1 info frigo-db-staging-v3
  --config wrangler.staging.jsonc --json` match the unique live staging name/ID
  to config and packet Phase B; packet Section 0 ID is different and must not
  be used. No ledger/schema read or remote writes were performed.
- [ ] Confirm the staging Environment credential and identity independently
  within PR #10's reviewed, exact-main read-only preflight. Local OAuth does
  not prove GitHub staging Environment access or authorize production changes.
- [ ] Review PR #10 staging-only workflow, merge via maintainer on `main`,
  rerun exact-main CI;
  only then dispatch from main using the staging Environment and exact SHA.
  Do not use the production D1 workflow for staging.
- [ ] Certify live D1 identity, ledger, bookmark, FK/quick checks, catalog and
  0039; then D1 500/T20-OFF deploy + smoke, V2-ON deploy + full staging E2E.
  No remote staging D1 read/write or T20 enablement was done in this task.
- [ ] T20 production release requires a separately authorized task;
  `production_migration=NO`, `production_deploy=NO`,
  `production_enablement=NO` here.

- [ ] T20 staging certification still pending; keep paired T20 flags OFF.
  No staging D1 migration or production mutation in this task.

## T20 PR #8 → #9 chain — live gate, 2026-09-26 UTC

- [x] C5 P1 same-slot prefix safety `ab83d35`; affected later meals `5c6835e`;
  V1 family/reviewed-evidence precision `6c68d8d`. Injected reviewed

- [ ] C1 PR #8 normal merge and exact-main CI: #8 OPEN at `16c5aae`,
  MERGEABLE/CLEAN, zero unresolved threads, hosted `validate` `36233377483`
  SUCCESS. `main` `bf57451` last CI `36221190222` FAILED. No agent merge.
- [ ] PR #9 sync to merged `main`, retarget from #8 branch, then require
  exact-head hosted CI SUCCESS, zero unresolved reviews, mergeable, normal
  maintainer merge and exact-main CI SUCCESS. Stacked PR #9 has no hosted CI.
- [ ] Staging identity/ledger and 0039 migration/deploy certification require
  separately verified authorized staging access. No staging or production
  migration/deploy/enablement occurred; both T20 flags remain OFF.

## T20 PR #8 CI fix — lock/regenerate race, 2026-09-26 UTC

- [x] Final PR #8 merge-readiness audit: current main `bf57451`, reviewed
  head `5b0a6b9`, hosted `validate` `36226026618` SUCCESS; MERGEABLE/CLEAN,
  zero unresolved review threads; fresh focused T20 suites 37/37 PASS and
  `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. No new migration/configuration
  change in #8. This is merge readiness, not T20 production certification.
- [ ] Maintainer merges PR #8 normally (agents cannot merge protected main),
  verifies exact-main CI, retargets stacked PR #9 to main and certifies it.
  No staging D1 migration/deploy or production mutation in this pass.

---

PR #8 hosted `validate` run `36225377465` failed 1/4554:
`competing lock/regenerate` got `[200, 404]`. Regenerate won; the losing PATCH
targeted the unlocked legacy component, which the winning regenerate replaced.
Test-only fix (`754fb2e`): the race
now targets the locked rice component, which regenerate preserves by ID, so the
loser always reaches the revision fence (409 `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`); final
state asserted for both winners. Executed: flows file 5/5 runs PASS (16 tests);
throwaway sequential regenerate-then-stale-PATCH check PASS (409, rice still
locked; not committed); `pnpm typecheck` PASS; eslint on the file PASS.

Follow-up finding (production code NOT changed, per scope): `MealCompositionService.load`
reads the plan row and `readPlanCompositions` in separate awaits. A stale
component edit can pass `assertRevision` on the old row, then read a newer
composition and fail with 404 `COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND` before the fenced write.
Writes remain revision-fenced (no data loss); only the error classification is
wrong. Next: reclassify to `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT` when the plan revision
moved (or read row + compositions in one batch), with a regression test.

# T20 post-merge CI fix + picker cuisine filter, 2026-09-26 UTC

Branch `fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine` from main `bf57451` (PR #7 merge).
- `87c8e64` (test-only): main CI run `36221190222` failed at
  `tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-flows.test.ts:177` because the
  add/remove race can legitimately be won by DELETE (empty composition) while
  the test assumed `components[0]`. The combined race is split into three
  independent cases; each asserts exactly one 200 + one typed 409
  (`PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`; auto-apply losing to a save may be the documented
  `PROPOSAL_STALE`) and a final state matching the winner. DELETE-wins refills
  at the current revision; lock/regenerate and save/auto-apply start from a
  deterministic sequential setup. No production logic changed.
- `65084fc`: T20 picker `cuisine` query (strict enum of existing `CuisineType`
  values), filtered server-side on stored recipe cuisine together with role/q/
  kind; simple foods have no cuisine and are excluded when the filter is set.
  UI: labelled cuisine select and filtered empty state with Clear filters.
  Candidate authority, hard restrictions, composer, shopping, T19 unchanged.

Executed: focused `vitest run` of t20-meal-composer-ui, t20-roles-picker-shopping,
t20-meal-composition-flows, t20-meal-composition-http: 4 files / 37 tests PASS;
flows file 6/6 repeated runs PASS; DELETE-first sequence verified with a
throwaway sequential test (not committed). `pnpm typecheck`, lint PASS.
`pnpm check` on `65084fc`: typecheck, lint PASS; vitest 4,552 PASS / 2 FAIL —
`tests/unit/d1-readonly-query.test.mjs` and
`tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` hit the 5 s default timeout in
this sandbox (both PASS with `--testTimeout=60000`, ~6.2 s each; unrelated to
T20). Because the script stops at tests, `pnpm check:migrations`
(`migration-smoke=ok`) and `pnpm build` (`✓ built in 10.45s`) were run
separately: PASS. `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. The running-app
UI check was not performed (the T20 UI flag stays off here). Nothing merged,
deployed or migrated; production D1 not accessed; no T20 flags enabled.

Next: open a PR from this branch, confirm hosted `validate` is green (it should
no longer flake at the old line 177), then run a flag-enabled local visual check
of the picker cuisine select before any T20 release.

# T20 PR #7 — final merge audit, 2026-09-26 UTC

**No code change needed.** Reviewed head `6882ba3` / main `136cb6f`:
hosted `validate` run `36217584128` SUCCESS, MERGEABLE/CLEAN and no review
comments; PR diff check PASS. Focused `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts`
PASS (4 files / 46 tests). Previously `pnpm check` on application head
`0b465d5` PASS (201 files / 4,549 tests, migration smoke, build); reviewed
head differs only in docs. No remote D1 checks or production mutations run here.

Next: verify exact-head CI for this docs-only receipt; user decides merge.
D1 operator applies 0039 before deployment; release owner enables the paired
default-off flags only after migration. These are deployment-only follow-ups.

# T20 PR #7 — remaining P2 budget items, 2026-09-26 UTC

**Status: `T20_PR7_READY_FOR_FINAL_REVIEW`.** Reviewed main
`136cb6f`; prior head `a337a2b` has hosted `validate` SUCCESS (run
`36216083854`). The final-pass
head `0b465d5` removes a stray EOF blank line from the PR diff, with no logic
change. Full PR diff check now PASS; application-head `validate` SUCCESS (run
`36216675722`), handoff head `d7aef32` `validate` SUCCESS (run `36217199489`,
MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no review comments).
Implementation checkpoints: `e3aef74` (P2-1) and `4f60157` (P2-2).

| Item | Implementation | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P2-1 total candidate pool ≤ 320 | Ranked recipes; eligible simple foods reserve slots in the same cap; multi-role fair quota then global-rank backfill | `t20-composer-candidates.test.ts`: 3 PASS; 320 recipes + foods, rare roles, deep favorite, reverse catalog, hard filters, determinism |
| P2-2 scoring operations ≤ budget | Check before `scoreComposition`, stop/cached frontier on exhaustion, no hidden output scoring | `t20-meal-composition.test.ts`: 17 PASS; 1/3/0 limits, locks and hard compatibility |

Focused cross-layer regressions (Manual T03, Assisted/Auto, family shopping,
substitutions, feature flags, T19): 6 files / 68 tests PASS before the last
zero-budget test. `pnpm typecheck`, `git diff --check`: PASS. Full `pnpm check`
PASS: typecheck, lint, 201 Vitest files / 4,549 tests, migration smoke
(`migration-smoke=ok`) and build (`✓ built in 6.64s`). Remote schema and
Week parity skipped locally. Independent focused review: no new P0/P1/P2.
Final-pass `pnpm typecheck`: PASS; focused `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts
tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-http.test.ts`: 3 files / 23 tests PASS;

fixed in `0b465d5`). `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, 201 test files /
4,549 tests, `migration-smoke=ok`, build (`✓ built in 6.72s`); remote schema
and Week parity skipped locally. Independent code and release audits:
no new P0/P1/P2 or merge blockers. Deployment requires 0039 on target D1;
the paired Worker/UI flag defaults off and needs a release-owner opt-in after
migration. Final narrow check: `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts`
PASS (4 files / 46 tests); `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. No
implementation change in this final audit.
**Next:** verify CI on the exact PR head immediately before a user-authorized
merge. No merge/deploy/production D1 mutation authorized here.
No merge, deploy, production migration/data change, flag enablement or T19
authority change.

# Tako-san T20 PR #7 review remediation (4 × P1 + candidate-cap P2) - 2026-09-26 UTC

**Status: `T20_REVIEW_P1_REMEDIATED` — local `pnpm check` PASS (200 files /
4,541 tests); PR #7 hosted `validate` run `36210020774` SUCCESS on head
`424be56` (MERGEABLE, CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own run). Production untouched: no
deploy, no D1 migration, T19 authority unchanged (d1/0/cutover=true, 500).**

`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2` (PR #7), review base head `febeb1f`; implementation commit `2e4f878`.

Fixed (review findings on PR #7; the earlier "P1 = 0" claim was wrong):
- P1 Manual hard safety: T03 `evaluateHardRestrictions` extracted from
  `evaluateRankingEligibility` (behaviour unchanged) is the single definition.
  New `packages/recipes/src/composition/restrictions.ts` judges every component a
  Manual mutation adds (add/swap/replace, and Assisted/Auto apply) on the same
  T02 candidate (slot inventory, planner substitution policy, server evidence
  provider) that Auto ranks: dietary/allergen unknown, time unknown/over, hard
  nutrition unknown/conflict, forbidden (incl. used substitutes), never-recommend
  → 422 `HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`. Simple foods use the same function in Auto,
  Manual and picker (Auto previously ignored time/nutrition for simple foods).
  No manual override model.
- P1 V1 family meals: composition routes (Manual/Assist/Auto) return 422
  `LEGACY_FAMILY_COMPOSITION_UNSUPPORTED` up front; the UI keeps V1 "Swap meal"
  and shows no composer for family slots. Family slots are now projected
  (`legacy_family`, exact T04 variant identity), so composed-plan shopping no
  longer drops their demand (it silently did before); an unresolvable variant is
  409 `COMPOSITION_REVALIDATION_REQUIRED`.
- P1 shopping substitution authority: `EvaluationScope` requires
  `substitutions/approvedSubstitutionIds/activeConstraints`, built by
  `evaluationScope(context)` from the same planning context as the planner and
  Auto. (The production context still supplies empty lists — no reviewed registry.)
- P1 flags: `deploy.yml` input `meal_composition_v2_enabled` (default false) →
  `release-check.mjs gate` normalizes once (manifest `mealCompositionV2Enabled`)
  → Build `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` + Worker `--var
  MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` in staging and production; `scripts/composition-flags.mjs
  verify` fails unless server/UI/manifest/compiled value (`dist/composition-flags.json`,
  written by a Vite build plugin outside `dist/client`) agree. Wrangler configs
  default `"false"`. Production build moved to its own step after local gates.
  UI falls back to V1 controls when the composition API 404s (mismatch).
- P2 candidate bias: all role-matching recipes are generated and ranked; the 320
  cap applies after ranking with a per-role quota (no catalog-order truncation).
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_SERVER=false` drills the UI-on/server-off
  mismatch in the isolated preview.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck (app + worker), lint, Vitest **200 files / 4,541
  tests** (612.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build.
- New suites: `tests/unit/t20-composition-safety.test.ts` (13),
  `tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts` (5),
  `tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs` (17), +4 UI cases in
  `tests/unit/t20-meal-composer-ui.test.tsx`. Verified to fail on the old code:
  all 5 integration cases and the 2 UI family/mismatch cases.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser, 390×844): flags on →
  composer shown, V1 swap hidden, Manual add of rice persisted; UI on/server off →
  compositions 404, V1 "Đổi món" shown, no composer. Family slot not browser-tested
  (static preview catalog has no families; covered by jsdom + HTTP tests).
- `deploy.yml` not executed on GitHub Actions (only parsed and unit-tested).

Remaining debt (not blocking): picker still lists recipes with
`constraintState: unknown` when safety is requested (server rejects on save);
role heuristics (staple 0 / dessert 0 in catalog); per-component servings.

Next: operator merge decision on PR #7 (not merged by the agent). After merge,
production Deploy fails closed until 0039 is applied through *Production D1
migration* (`expected_pre_tip=0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`,
`migration=0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`); staging D1 needs 0039 before its flag
is enabled. Automatic staging deploys ship the flag off. Then dispatch Deploy with
`meal_composition_v2_enabled=true` (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

run `36197958265` SUCCESS on implementation head `0db541da8619fdf03f21bc4fb93d081fa335a0d5` (MERGEABLE,
CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own PR-head run). T19: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. Production
untouched: recipe authority d1/0/cutover=true, 500 recipes; no T20 deploy; no
production D1 migration.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`
`starting_main=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`
`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`

Implemented (ADR-031, `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2.md`):
- T20A: additive migration `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`
  (`generated_meal_plan_compositions`, `generated_meal_plan_components`,
  `recipe_role_assignments`; partial unique indexes for one dish per meal);
  domain model, closed role enum, deterministic role rules with provenance,
  nine bounded simple foods, flexible meal profiles, V1 read-time projection.
- T20B: server-authoritative Manual builder API (add/remove/swap/lock/role/
  reorder/replace) sharing the plan `revision` behind a batch fence; picker
  (summary DTOs, role/kind/text filters, stable offset cursor, ≤ 24/page).
- T20C/D: Assisted (complete / regenerate unlocked) and Auto (top ≤ 3) on one
  bounded, deterministic beam search; suggestions never write; apply recomputes
  and requires the same option ID; locks are domain-enforced.
- T20E: all components of all meals projected against one running T04
  inventory projection, then unchanged T05 aggregation (single subtraction).
- T20F: composed week cards, meal composer, picker bottom sheet/dialog,
  suggestion panels; vi/en; lock `aria-pressed`, one polite live region, focus
  restoration, Escape cancels without mutation.
- V1: unedited slots read as `main / legacy_v1`; V1 schemas unchanged; V1 swap
  on a composed slot is 409 `COMPOSITION_MANAGED_SLOT`; V1 regenerate keeps
  locked components; V1 shopping projects components. Flag off = pre-T20.
- Flags: `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (server) and
  `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (UI), both default off, independent of T19.
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2=true node scripts/security-preview.mjs`
  opts the isolated preview into V2 (default off keeps the T06B browser suite).

Role distribution on the 500-recipe D1 release (pinned test): main 362, side
87, soup 70, vegetable 37, simple_food 7, staple 0, dessert 0; unclassified 0,
invalid 0, duplicates 0, contradictions 0, review-required 0.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19, sqlite3):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, Vitest **197 files / 4,502 tests**
  (725.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build. T20 suites: 6 files / 48 tests; T19
  authority suites (split 11, persistence 18, observability 19) PASS;
  d1-schema-gate 9 PASS.
- Earlier full run: 4,496/4,497 with one unrelated 5 s timeout in
  `production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` under parallel load; that file passed
  48/48 in isolation and in the final `pnpm check`.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser): 375×812, 390×844,
  768×1024, 1280×900 — plan generation, V1 cards, composer, Auto options and
  accept, picker keyboard focus/Escape return, no horizontal overflow, no
  unnamed controls.

Not done / deferred: leftovers (T20B/T21), per-component servings, role review
tooling and AI-assisted offline role proposals, picker ingredient/cuisine
filters, whole-week Auto, price-aware scoring. `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json`
gets the 0039 hash only after the migration is applied (fixture policy).

Next: independent review of PR #7 (not merged by the agent); require exact-head
hosted `validate` on the final head.
Rollout (separately authorized): apply 0039 to staging then production D1 (the
schema gate fails closed on a 0038 ledger), then enable both flags. Do not change
T19 recipe authority.

# Historical T19 operator closure / T20 unlocked - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. T20: `UNLOCKED`.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`
`main_baseline=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f` (PR #6 merge)

T19 closure was accepted by the operator based on the successful final D1
deployment, the rollback proof, the final restoration, exact-main CI, the
existing production read-only certification and runtime release evidence.
The evidence below is operator-reported for runs on the same main SHA; this
agent did not re-run or re-read those production runs in this task.

- Exact-main CI `36149295615` SUCCESS; current-main staging `36149849086`
  SUCCESS.
- Production sequence: shadow `36150427552`, canary-1 `36151130515`,
  canary-5 `36152198646`, canary-25 `36153116467`, first d1 `36153948951`
  (all SUCCESS).
- Rollback proof `36154980456` SUCCESS (d1 → shadow): PASS.
- Final restore: canary-1 `36167843671`, canary-5 `36176092421`, canary-25
  `36176824421`, final d1 `36183890785` (all SUCCESS): PASS.
- Final production authority: `mode=d1`, `percent=0`, `cutover=true`,
  `source=d1`, served recipes `500`, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`,
  `fallback=null`, runtime fingerprint `f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`.

**The final post-rollout read-only recertification was waived by the
operator. No post-final-D1 certification run occurred; do not invent a PASS
receipt for it.**

T20 (Meal Composition V2) is unlocked and implemented on
`feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`; see the T20 section above this one once it is
recorded. T20 must not change production recipe authority (d1/0/true, 500).

# Historical T19 same-SHA promotion convergence fix - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_D1_PROMOTION_CONVERGENCE_FIX_IN_REVIEW`. Production at
`canary-25` on `a3e1614`; d1 attempt rolled back. T19 incomplete, T20
blocked.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [done] Rollout on `a3e1614`: shadow `36140227253`, canary-1
  `36141391948`, canary-5 `36142331814`, canary-25 `36143861402` SUCCESS.
- [evidence] d1 `36144837880`: commit-only readiness wait passed at attempt
  1 while the canary-25 version still answered; smoke failed on mode;
  restore retried and recorded `restored` (step SUCCESS).
- [done] Readiness wait now requires the approved authority state and 3
  consecutive matches; authority proof polls only the pre-deploy state;
  both bounded, all other mismatches fail closed. Workflow YAML unchanged.
  `pnpm check` PASS (191 files / 4,453 tests).
- [next] Merge → new-main CI → staging → certification → shadow on the new
  SHA (rollback checkbox on) → canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1 → rollback proof →
  final d1.

# Historical T19 legacy-Worker bootstrap fix - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_PRODUCTION_BOOTSTRAP_FIX_IN_REVIEW`. Production Worker
unchanged (pre-T19). T19 incomplete, T20 blocked.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [evidence] Deploy `36133649176` missing token; `36134994434` preflight
  401 from legacy Worker. No production deploy step ran.
- [done] Classified legacy 401 via the snapshotted Worker's `GIT_COMMIT`
  (ancestor + lacks route), not via body code (legacy returns
  `TOKEN_INVALID` with Bearer). Restore handles the same case. Tests +8;
  `pnpm check` PASS (191 files / 4,440 tests).
- [next] Merge PR → new-main CI → staging PASS → read-only certification
  → shadow bootstrap on the new SHA → canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1 → rollback
  proof → final d1.

# Historical T19 production certification PASS / rollout - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_PRODUCTION_SHADOW_DISPATCH_REQUIRED`. T19 incomplete,
T20 blocked. Production Worker unchanged (pre-T19 `4677ebbabbb580b9045423350da719acaf8f5742`).**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [done] PR #4 merged; main `860380887350d4ab93e4d5e66a0fa4e074397608`, implementation identical to
  `399ec9b`. CI `36131217435` PASS.
- [done] Staging `36131763935` PASS on new SHA (static/0, 71, no fallback).
- [done] Production read-only certification `36132078167` PASS: ledger 0038,
  500/500 catalog + runtime fingerprint, FK/quick_check ok, rollback baseline
  `aada9b9d-93f9-4db5-97a6-d5c4741a67e7` / `4677ebbabbb580b9045423350da719acaf8f5742`.
- [done] D1 migration not required (ledger already at repository tip).
- [blocked] Production shadow bootstrap dispatch: agent HTTP 403. Owner must
  dispatch; reviewer approves.
- [next] shadow (bootstrap checkbox on) → canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1 → rollback
  proof d1→shadow (checkbox on) → shadow → canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1 final;
  same SHA throughout, no main merges. Inspect each receipt before the next.

# Historical T19 exact patch handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`; implementation patch
prepared for authorized reviewer but not published. T19/T20 BLOCKED.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [done] Exported exact implementation commit `399ec9b` as a single-commit
  patch covering six files (two workflows, D1 query helper, safety tests,
  sandbox sqlite3 setup); no preceding documentation commits included.
  `git diff --check 399ec9b^ 399ec9b` PASS and `git apply --check -`
  against an isolated `origin/main` archive PASS.
- [blocked] GitHub App workflow-file write gate persists. No remote branch
  or PR published; main remains `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`. Production certification
  `36101940395` FAIL, no new production activity by this handoff.
- [next] Authorized maintainer applies exact patch, runs checks, opens PR;
  after review/merge require new-main CI, new-SHA staging and a separately
  approved production read-only certification. No T20.

# Historical T19 workflow publication gate - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`; local repair tested,
not published. Production certification FAIL, T19/T20 BLOCKED, no production
mutation by this patch.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [done] Local implementation checkpoint `399ec9b`; docs checkpoint
  `17ab64c`. `pnpm check` PASS (lint, typecheck, 191 files / 4,432 tests,
  migration smoke, build). See historical section below for root-cause and
  exact run `36101940395` evidence.
- [blocked] `git push origin HEAD:hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` was remote
  rejected: GitHub App lacks `workflows` permission for
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Credential active and repository ID matches.
  No remote branch/PR, no main move; docs or code must not be published
  separately to bypass workflow-file controls.
- [next] Restore an authorized workflow-file write route (integration
  permission grant, or authorized maintainer publishes the tested patch),
  open PR for review, merge normally; then require exact-new-main CI,
  new-SHA staging PASS and owner/reviewer-approved read-only production
  certification PASS. Do not attempt D1 migration, rollout, or T20 yet.
- [checks] `credential_control status`; denied explicit-ref push;
  `git ls-remote` target ref absent; `gh pr list` empty; remote main GET
  still `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`. No new remote job run by the agent.

# Historical T19 read-only certification query repair - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_PRODUCTION_READ_ONLY_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED`; old-main staging
PASS, production cert FAILURE, T19 and T20 BLOCKED. No production mutation by
this repair.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [evidence] Owner run `36101940395` at `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`: gate, post-approval
  exact-main and production identity/rollback baseline PASS; remote D1 schema
  gate PASS (exact 0001–0038 ledger and foreign keys). Following Wrangler
  `--file schema-gate.sql` exited 1; receipt has no production certification
  PASS, catalog/runtime/integrity evidence. The exit cause is not proven.
- [done] Audited pinned Wrangler 3.114.17: remote `--file` routes to D1
  `/import` and cannot return SELECT rows; `--command` routes to `/query`.
  Replaced the three certification `--file` calls with a guarded fixed-name
  helper: 1 schema + 2 catalog + 5 runtime SELECTs, exact JSON checks and no
  partial output. Changed existing Deploy runtime proof to use the same
  query path; protected gates and D1 verifier code unchanged.
- [done] Focused 5 files / 260 tests PASS; `pnpm check` PASS: lint,
  typecheck, 191 test files / 4,432 tests, migration smoke and build. Diff
  check PASS. `check:migrations` initially failed due missing sqlite3 CLI;
  committed `.hoplite/setup.sh` makes prerequisite durable,
  `sandbox_control setup` PASS and standalone `pnpm check:migrations`
  PASS (`migration-smoke=ok`). Implementation checkpoint `399ec9b`.
- [blocked] Production certification is **not** PASS. No promotion or T20.
- [next] Review/merge repair PR, verify exact-new-main hosted CI and
  **new-SHA** staging PASS, then owner dispatches new read-only production
  certification with required production reviewer and inspect its complete
  PASS artifact. Do not rerun failed jobs of old run as a substitute.

# Historical T19 staging PASS / certification task board - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_OWNER_TRANSFER_CONTROL_PLANE_MISMATCH`: Actions dispatch
HTTP 403. Staging `PASS`; production certification `NOT STARTED`;
T19 and T20 `BLOCKED`. Production unchanged.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [evidence] Historical Deploy `36018964086` rerun attempt 2 skipped every
  job, no artifact/deploy; reason for event-gate mismatch not yet proven.
- [done] Owner manually dispatched reviewed Deploy `36092413084` against
  exact main `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`. Release/staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED.
  Staging preflight (formerly Cloudflare code 10000), build, CI recheck,
  deploy, exact-SHA smoke and authority proof all SUCCESS.
- [done] Verified receipt `release-staging-36092413084-1`: staging deployed
  exact SHA, `static/0/cutover=false`, source `static`, 71 served recipes,
  release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, fallback null; hosted smoke confirms readiness
  and database `ok`. D1 readiness `not_evaluated` in static mode; no
  production D1 claim. Main and CI `36018278513` still match.
- [blocked] Production Read-Only Certification workflow active, production
  reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` still required. Attempted exact-main dispatch
  using the approved full SHA/hardening SHA from staging receipt, but GitHub
  installation rejected it with HTTP 403. No certification run or mutation.
- [next] Owner dispatches **Production Read-Only Certification** from `main`
  via GitHub UI: full `ref` = `sha`, `hardened_sha` = `hardenedSha` in
  `release-manifest.json` from artifact `release-staging-36092413084-1`;
  confirm read-only = true. Respect required reviewer approval and require
  full PASS/production unchanged receipt before any D1 migration or rollout.
  No T20.
- [checks] Run/attempt/job/artifact GETs; candidate/staging artifact download
  and safe-field inspection; bounded hosted staging smoke/authority log;
  `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`, main/CI API checks, production
  Environment and certification workflow GETs; attempted cert dispatch
  (HTTP 403). No local application tests (code and workflows unchanged).

T20: `BLOCKED`. Production unchanged.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [reported] Owner says dedicated staging Cloudflare token was set in the
  GitHub staging Environment. `gh secret list --env staging` still gives HTTP
  403 to this installation; no token value, type or update time verified.
- [done] Fetched unchanged `origin/main=f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, canonical ID
  `1385308553`, hosted CI `36018278513` `validate` SUCCESS, and exact-main
  Deploy `36018964086` event `workflow_run`, attempt 1, release SUCCESS,
  staging FAILURE (code 10000), production SKIPPED. Deploy YAML unchanged.
- [blocked] `gh run rerun 36018964086 -R tako-vn1/Tako-san` was refused:
  `Resource not accessible by integration`. Attempt remains 1; no staging or
  production deploy occurred. Read-only Cloudflare OAuth cannot list Worker
  secret metadata; do not use ad-hoc deploy or unrelated main commits.
- [next] Owner uses **Re-run jobs → Re-run all jobs** on
  `https://github.com/tako-vn1/Tako-san/actions/runs/36018964086` to recreate
  the release artifact for new attempt. After initiation, verify all staging

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- [blocked] After owner authorized the agent to act, `credential_control
  rotate` issued a fresh GitHub installation credential but staging secret
  metadata and Actions-policy GETs still return HTTP 403. Cloudflare `whoami`
  still reports only read-only OAuth scopes, no local API token is available,
  main remains `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, and last Deploy is failure `36018964086`.
  No token/secret mutation or workflow dispatch attempted. Grant the actual
  Cloudflare API Tokens Write and GitHub Environment Secrets write permissions
  via approved integrations, or securely provision the token and staging secret
  in provider UIs; do not share a value in chat.
- [done] Owner-approved Cloudflare device login with temporary Wrangler
  `4.119.0`: `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device --browser=false
  --scopes user:read account:read` succeeded. Sanitized `whoami` verified
  deployment account ID `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`; actual granted scopes are
  `user:read`, `account:read`, `offline_access`.
- [blocked] Wrangler OAuth does not offer Cloudflare `API Tokens Write`, which
  `POST /user/tokens` requires. Do not store temporary OAuth access tokens as
  GitHub CI credentials. Managed GitHub App cannot administer Environment
  secrets. Its `gh api user` 403 does not mean the owner lacks a browser login;
  previous `TAKOSAN_GITHUB_LOGIN_REQUIRED` wording below was too strong.
- [evidence] Main remains `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`) by GitHub commits API;
  exact-main CI `36018278513` passed but staging Deploy `36018964086`
  failed on Cloudflare code `10000` before deployment. Worker and staging D1
  identity have not been proven remotely in this read-only session.
- [checks] `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 --version`, `login --help`,
  `login --scopes-list`, device login, sanitized `whoami`,
  `gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main --jq .sha`, `gh auth status`,
  `git status --short --branch`, `git diff --check` and assertions for current
  T19 identities, blockers and historical records in all three docs; no local
  tests (no code changed).
- [next] Owner creates a durable staging Cloudflare API token with only the
  account-scoped Worker-scripts write access required by reviewed preflight
  and deploy, and securely updates **only** the GitHub `staging` Environment
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in the UI (never paste it in chat). Verify the token
  and staging identity, rerun reviewed exact-main staging Deploy, then proceed
  only on PASS. Production and T20 stay gated.

  `0899c49a28906d09f1a51b8afe2c72e09c860f18` into `main` as
  `d6204d91b1849bf98df89c1c590e74395c494c89`.
- [done] PR-head CI run `36007943241` passed protected context `validate`.
- [done] Exact-main CI run `36009002161` exists as a real GitHub Actions
  `push/main` run for `d6204d91` and passed lint, typecheck, 190 files / 4,415
  tests, migration smoke and build.
- [done] Classified the reported zero-run defect as a stale post-merge
  observation: CI was created four seconds after the human merge. Workflow state,
  triggers, Actions policy, skip semantics and branch protection are correct; no
  CI or repository-setting repair was required.
- [done] Automatic Deploy run `36009510442` followed exact-main CI. Release and
  staging succeeded; production was skipped. Exact deployed SHA `d6204d91`, mode
  `static`, canary `0`, cutover `false`, source `static`, 71 served recipes and
  null fallback were recorded.
- [done] Current operational docs corrected without changing application,
  workflow, migration or release code.
- [done] Docs recovery PR #2 merged `2002dfd2` as `a86ed095`;
  exact-main CI `36016668591` passed and automatic Deploy `36017207468` was
  created through `workflow_run`.
- [blocked] Deploy `36017207468`: release SUCCESS, production SKIPPED, staging
  failed closed before build/deploy because Cloudflare rejected the stored GitHub
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` with authentication code `10000`. No `a86ed095`
  deployment occurred; live staging remains healthy on `d6204d91`.
- [evidence] All three staging secret names remain present. The local Wrangler
  OAuth session can refresh and list the existing Worker `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`,
  isolating the failure to the static OAuth access-token snapshot stored in
  GitHub rather than a missing Worker secret.
- [next] Provision a durable least-privilege Cloudflare API token and replace only
  the staging Environment `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, then repeat the reviewed staging
  path.
- [follow-up] Existing dependency audit and `usehoplite` App-side zero-check-run
  behavior remain separate.
- [blocked] Production Read-Only Certification, production deploy/D1/secrets/
  traffic/rollback and T20 require separate explicit authorization.
- [next] Independent remote review of the exact-main state; do not start rollout
  automatically.

# Historical T19 production read-only certification workflow - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_PRODUCTION_CERT_WORKFLOW_PR_PENDING`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**

- [done] Re-resolved repository `1368281478` / `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`; main
  `a4b5d726` and exact-main CI `35817133131` PASS.
- [done] Staging certified: Deploy `35817440484`, attempt 2, release/staging
  SUCCESS, production SKIPPED; exact-main static authority, 71 recipes, no fallback.
- [done] Dedicated manual, approval-gated read-only certification workflow;
  reused reviewed verifiers, guarded SQL, sanitized-only artifacts, rollback
  baseline reads, final main/ledger/Worker rechecks. No application/tooling change.
- [done] Focused 236/236 tests, lint/typecheck, local config check, migration smoke
  (after existing sqlite setup repair), build, diff/shell syntax checks. Local
  full suite exceeded 600 seconds (exit 124); hosted full-suite CI remains required.
- [blocked] Publication: GitHub App lacks `workflows` permission; push rejected,
  PR creation failed because no remote head branch exists. Implementation is
  retained locally at `aee4e2e`. Operator must authorize Workflows write for this
  installation before publication can resume; no credentials in chat.
- [pending] Narrow PR, exact-head hosted CI/review, maintainer merge, new main CI,
  production Environment approval and actual read-only certification.
- [not-started] Production rollout, cross-flow, rollback proof, final D1 restoration.
- [not-started] T20 (blocked until `T19_COMPLETE`).

See `CURRENT_STATE.md` for exact checks, limitations and next action.

# Release-secret provisioning receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_RELEASE_SECRET_PROVISIONING_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**

- [done] Repository ID `1368281478` = `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`; main `c0c8e82`
  unchanged; exact-main CI `35815588844` PASS; deploy.yml secret contract
  confirmed (staging: `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` + Worker
  `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`; production: `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` + Worker
  `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`).
- [blocked] Staging: run `35815905652` failed before deployment; GitHub
  effective `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` MISSING (runtime env evidence),
  Cloudflare secrets PRESENT, Worker secret UNKNOWN. Operator must provision the
  staging pair through authorized controls; this installation cannot.
- [not-started] Staging certification, production identity/D1 certification,
  production token pair, rollout, cross-flow, rollback proof.
- [not-started] T20 (blocked until `T19_COMPLETE`).

# Current takeover receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_CODE_COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository ID `1368281478` is `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`. Application PR #53 merged
normally at `03005fcbc39ab3c964393d2091f726088a4be5d0`; exact-head PR CI
`35810551334` and exact-main CI `35810986000` both PASS (189 files / 4,367 tests).
Integration reviewed head is `dbf32547a07fbc767e044365866a2bdfc4264cd8`; the
original recovery branch remains immutable at `0a04209e512d19293ed56a19d3fd51eb29ffefcd`.

Rechecked after the external merge: main remains `03005fc` and preserves the
exact recovered checkpoint. PR #54 carries this documentation-only handoff;
the application must not be reconstructed or republished as another PR.
Production D1 certification is blocked: this workspace has no Cloudflare API
token and `pnpm wrangler whoami` reports unauthenticated. Earlier takeover
evidence recorded missing GitHub verification secrets. Current repository and
Environment secret/variable listings return HTTP 403, so their present contents
cannot be independently verified here; Worker-side presence remains unverified.
Automatic staging run `35811338820` failed BEFORE deployment on the missing
staging verification secret; its production job was skipped. No deployment,
migration, secret change, rollout or rollback was performed.

See `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T19_V2_TAKEOVER_AUDIT.md` for evidence and operator
steps. Provision the release prerequisites, certify production read-only, then
use the reviewed rollout workflow and prove rollback. T19 is NOT complete;
T20 remains blocked. Earlier pending/publication-blocked claims below are
historical and superseded by this receipt.

# Frigo / Takosan current task board — 2026-09-22

## T19 V2 — recipe authority cutover (integration 2026-09-22)

- [done] Reproduced the split-authority defect on unmodified main (planner D1-only recipe under static; 404 detail/cook).
- [done] Fenced the planner to `resolveRecipeAuthority` (`projectPlannerCatalogOnAuthority`); alternatives/swap/regenerate authority-clean; fingerprint scoped to the visible universe; stored plan authority identity + `CATALOG_AUTHORITY_CHANGED`.
- [done] Cross-flow D1-only recipe test (planner → swap → shopping → detail → cook start/complete), all-mode matrix incl. D1-fallback-together and authority spoofing.
- [done] Release state machine `static|shadow|canary{1,2,5,25}|d1` with derived cutover; deploy workflow certifies `wrangler.jsonc` binding, Cloudflare/D1 identity, ledger, catalog identity/duplicates/order, FK and quick_check read-only; requires ref == current main; rejects backwards SHAs and stale/skipped/reverse transitions; explicit rollback/bootstrap intent; binding proof for previous and deployed versions; API rollback with full proof on failure or cancellation; staging fail-closed.
- [done] Public sanitized `recipeAuthority` readiness + protected `/health/recipe-authority` release evidence (strict Bearer token, no PII); canary and shadow probes exercise D1 truthfully.
- [done] Verified repository ID `1368281478`, current main `a3b1564`, and immutable original remote head `0a04209`; application checkpoint `558be74` is its ancestor.
- [done] Integrated `558be74` onto `feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2-integration` from current main, retaining PR #52's newer documentation truth.
- [done] Planner content and steps come from the authority snapshot in every mode; static reads no D1 planner rows; d1 enrichment (families, classifications, provenance, nutrition) is fenced to the visible universe and degrades to the authority-only projection on failure; unused D1 `recipe_steps` read removed.
- [done] Current-tree verification: full Vitest 189 files / 4,364 tests PASS; focused matrix 13 files / 356 PASS (+23 snapshot/persistence after the last cleanup); release-check 155, D1 certification 32, Worker rollback 10 PASS; lint, both typechecks, migration smoke, 500-recipe import check (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`), build and diff check PASS.
- [done] Two independent review passes; all findings fixed (see `T19_V2_WIP_HANDOFF.md`). Historical doc sections restored after an intermediate formatting pass.
- [blocked] Publication of the integration branch: GitHub App credential lacks `workflows` permission (push rejected; workflow changes NOT stripped, no partial branch). Recovery artifacts `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.bundle` / `.patch` are workspace-only. Owner push with a capable credential is the unblock. Status `T19_V2_APPLICATION_INTEGRATED_CI_PENDING` (safe stop 2026-09-23).
- [pending] Exact-head hosted CI/review, normal merge, exact-main certification.
- [pending] Read-only production identity/ledger/catalog certification, required release-token provisioning, staged rollout (shadow → canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1), representative flows and rollback proof. Production remains untouched.
- [historical] PR #52 and safe-stop publication records remain evidence; the original branch stays immutable.
- [not-started] T20 Meal Composition V2 (blocked until `T19_COMPLETE`).

## Google Safari profile recovery + registration-only Turnstile

- [done] Reproduced normal-profile failure and private/clean-profile success in
  WebKit; isolated the failure before backend OAuth at the service-worker/GIS
  request boundary.
- [done] Changed the PWA worker to bypass all cross-origin requests and reject
  same-origin uncached network failures without returning null.
- [done] Kept Turnstile mandatory for registration only; removed repeat widgets
  and tokens from login, forgot-password and resend.
- [done] Retained auth rate limiting, resend cooldown, CSRF and OTP security;
  blocked arbitrary register/login resend mail to unknown or verified accounts.
- [done] Focused 124/124, full Vitest 185 files / 4242 tests, lint, typecheck,
  migration smoke, build and diff check PASS.
- [done] Built-candidate WebKit smoke with active service worker: first GIS load
  blocked, retry recovered Google, warning cleared; CAPTCHA frames login 0 /
  registration 1.
- [next] Push branch, open PR, wait for exact-head hosted CI, merge/deploy, then
  run production WebKit and readiness smoke. No migration or configuration
  mutation required.

## T18E — `T18E_OTP_TEST_RECIPIENT_REQUIRED` (2026-09-22)

- [done] Verified stable repository ID, exact base/production `66627ff`, and
  created/pushed `feat/t18e-otp-email-delivery-recovery` without rebasing or
  touching concurrent Google work.
- [done] Confirmed `SEND_EMAIL` binding present; subsequently provisioned the
  operator-supplied `RESEND_API_KEY` as a production Worker secret without
  printing, storing, or committing its value. API authentication PASS.
- [blocked] Current sender authorization and production failure category remain
  UNKNOWN: available Cloudflare OAuth lacks stored Observability/Email Sending
  scope. No root cause was fabricated.
- [done] Hardened Workers Email -> Resend -> fail-closed routing, sanitized
  Resend/Cloudflare classification and structured diagnostics, and unexpected
  exception invalidation.
- [done] Readiness now separates provider configuration from delivery
  verification without sending email.
- [done] Certified registration, failure invalidation, fallback, resend
  recovery, forgot-password anti-enumeration, verify/single-use/expiry,
  Turnstile and no-production-leak contracts.
- [done] Focused 165/165; full Vitest 185 files / 4238 tests; lint, typecheck,
  migration smoke and build PASS. No migration or workflow change.
- [done] Review-only [PR #50](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/50)
  opened; hosted validate `35685553412` passed on `eec404a`; PR was
  `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`.
- [next] Require fresh exact-head CI after the final docs receipt; do not merge
  or deploy.
- [done] Operator completed the DNS correction; Resend reports
  `tungjpstore.net`, DKIM, and both SPF-purpose records as verified.
- [blocked] Verify the fixed sender in Cloudflare Email Service and supply an
  authorized test inbox before real delivery can be certified. See
  `T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md`.

## T18D — `T18D_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-22)

- [done] Stable-ID/base gate; CI #151/staging #53 success, production skipped;
  branch pushed from exact `07ace57241f8270b2458610979c709bb69b9a65a`; implementation freeze `d3ef61c`.
- [done] Four original findings and **seven** additional scoped P2s fixed;
  independent review open P0/P1/P2 = **0/0/0**; two P3 observations deferred.
- [done] 27-screen semantic review: **14 PASS / 13 PASS_WITH_NOTE / 0 FAIL**.
- [done] Focused browser **14/14 PASS in 42.8s**, strict axe violations **0**; final
  repository logs pass with **185 files / 4226 tests in 333.25s**.
- [done] Settled full matrix: **349 PASS / 5 intentional skips / 0 FAIL**,
  354 cases in 23.3m; all **84 T18D cases PASS**. Strict axe violations **0**
  across 162 canonical checks. Duplicate breakpoint instances alone skipped;
  log `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled.log`, artifacts under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled/`. The prior run stopped near
  case 158 on pre-settle scan-review opacity/receipt enable sampling; parent
  patched a 350ms wait after async CTA enable, with no axe/token changes.
- [done] Fresh style residuals **39/0**, contrast **33/33**, lint/typecheck and
  `git diff --check` PASS after test-only settle correction.
- [done] Review-only [PR #49](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/49)
  OPEN; publication checkpoint `fe1b5d4` pushed. Auto-fix enabled, auto-merge off.
- [next] Hosted CI/review settlement; initial `validate` IN_PROGRESS in run
  `35677663372` at 01:57 UTC, no unresolved threads then.
  No merge/deploy. VoiceOver/NVDA NOT PERFORMED. See
  `T18D_HUMAN_STYLE_A11Y_REVIEW.md` for exact evidence.

## Historical T18C receipt

**Previous: T18C_READY_FOR_REVIEW**, application freeze `6f8f6f4`.

- [done] Existing branch/repository ID `1368281478` preserved; matching upstream,
  unchanged base, pre-existing workspace settings excluded.
- [done] Supplied source verified; 27/27 direct comparisons with fresh six-width
  evidence. **2 PASS / 25 PASS_WITH_DOCUMENTED_DIFFERENCE**, no unresolved P0/P1/P2.
- [done] Browser **379 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 390 unique**; 162 canonical
  + 449 regression screenshot files; zero strict axe violations or overflow.
  Five unfinished cases recovered after outer timeouts; full manifest reconciled.
- [done] Serial final `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (**184/4222**),
  `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, style residuals (**39/0**), contrast
  (**33/33**), worktree and base-to-HEAD `git diff --check` PASS.
- [done] Preserve baseline, failed Home zoom run, interrupted contention logs
  and final evidence separately. No test timeout/coverage weakening.
- [done] Review-only [PR #48](https://github.com/vn-tako/Frigo-dev/pull/48)
  opened from published checkpoint `321824d`; CI/review auto-fix enabled,
  auto-merge disabled. No merge conflict or initial review feedback.
- [done] Hosted `validate` SUCCESS on `289d80a`, run `35578662531`; no review
  feedback/unresolved threads; `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`. Final release audit found
  no introduced migration/configuration action. Style/contrast/diff rechecks PASS.
- [pending] Owner merge permission after latest-head CI stays green; this
  readiness receipt changes docs only. Human VoiceOver/NVDA not performed.
  Auto-merge remains disabled. No merge, deploy or T18D.

See `T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and
`.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/EVIDENCE.md` for exact checks, failures and next action.

## Historical continuation checkpoints (superseded)

- [done] Final combined run exposed Home 1024px/200%-text P2 (46px overflow):
  **378 passed / 11 intentional skips / 1 failed**. Rem-based wrapping fix plus
  unchanged zoom gate and new region-stacking check: **12/12 focused PASS**.
- [in progress] Preserve failed run, regenerate all 390 cases in isolated
  viewport groups and repeat full repository gates after the Home correction.

- [done] Final unfiltered repository gates on `b024b0d`: **184 files / 4222
  tests**, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff-check; style 39/0,
  contrast 33/33. Evidence: `repository-gates.zip`.
- [in progress] Finish final six-viewport browser run and post-fix visual review,
  then publish review-only PR. No merge/deploy/T18D.

- [done] Explicit 44px native target bounds; unchanged strict gate plus keyboard
  and flag-off checks: 14 PASS / 1 intentional project skip. Final rerun next.

- [done] Independent review P2: remove inert non-recipe Week title buttons;
  regression 2 red → 5 green, flag-off routed browser 1 PASS, re-review clear.
- [in progress] Restart final gates and 390 browser cases after that correction;
  preserve interrupted 384-case attempt as non-final evidence.

- [done] Close evidenced keyboard/checked-state gaps in inventory, recipes,
  shopping, shell and legacy Week controls; focused units 37/37, browser
  12/12 plus sibling-action follow-up 1/1, typecheck/ESLint/diff PASS.
- [in progress] Fresh full gates and unfiltered 384-case browser certification;
  final artifacts remain separate from the immutable baseline.

- [done] Direct approved-source comparison of 27 identities and evidence-led
  keyboard, semantic and responsive corrections; no protected business change.
- [done] Focused browser gates 43 passed/5 intentional skips, 18 passed,
  supplemental boundary 1 passed; fresh typecheck passed. Logs retained in
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/fix-verification.zip`.
- [pending] Final combined browser/matrix, native gates, screenshot review,
  certification report and review-only PR. No final readiness claim yet.

## T18C — final redesign certification — SAFE PAUSE (2026-09-21)

**STATUS: `T18C_PAUSED_SAFE`** — implementation halted by owner instruction;
all valid work committed/pushed; resume per
[T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md](T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md).

- **IN PROGRESS:** 27/27 identities baselined at six widths (route/overflow/nav
  162/162); 11 identities have applied semantic fixes awaiting the rerun.
- **BLOCKED:** Direct approved Takosan OS source absent; 0/27 boards compared.
  Reconstructed registry and legacy Frigo kit cannot certify visual parity.
- **Next:** Baseline checkpoint, evidence-led semantic corrections, final
  responsive/state/a11y/gate runs and durable screenshot/report publication.
  [Registry and findings](T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md). No merge/deploy/T18D.

## T18B — payment authority unification — `T18B_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- [done] Final review P1 fixed from exact HEAD `0926222`: current price table
  governs new offers only; persisted issued intent governs status, signed
  callback matching, replay and entitlement. Operational prices unchanged.
  Strict persisted structure/expiry/status, client amount isolation and atomic
  once-per-order grants retained. New price-change/malformed-row regressions:
  focused **151/151**, including **65** server payment tests; full `pnpm test`
  **183 files / 4217 PASS**, browser six-width **48/48**, lint/typecheck/migration
  smoke/build/diff checks PASS. Exact commands, failures/recovery and new-head
  publication boundary are recorded in the T18B report.
- [done] Repository ID/main/clean tree/hosted CI/overlapping PR gates; branch
  `feat/t18b-payment-authority` from `13ff3f22082fc0601a81b90c96edded4741194ac`.
- [done] Audit and ADR-029; retained server prices 49000 monthly / 499000 annual
  VND. One server contract now drives metadata, intent and verified PayOS QR.
- [done] Atomic idempotent webhook grants, provider failure handling, owned
  status reads, retired shared-secret grants and client/session anti-tampering.
- [done] Checkpoints `2aba91a`, `c00ea9f`, `1cef30b`, `1aabd32` pushed;
  PR #47 OPEN with CI/review auto-fix, auto-merge disabled.
- [done] Focused 121/121, browser 48/48 plus final error-state 4/4, style/checkout 38/38;
  lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff check PASS. No remaining security findings.
- [done] Full rerun **183 files / 4185 tests PASS**, after correcting the first
  run's semantic-style failure in source without weakening coverage.
- [done] Readiness follow-up: CI `35554499704` passed at `2d6ff5a`, no review
  threads. Fixed exact-origin VietQR CSP and retired-secret readiness warning;
  new CSP regression red then green, focused 104/104, browser 48/48 under real
  image policy, lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/header parity/full-diff check
  PASS. New-head CI is independently verified on the PR before merge readiness.
- [limit] No real payment or live-provider certification. Provider setup and
  callback delivery are separately authorized release prerequisites. No merge,
  deploy, remote D1, new migration or unrelated protected-code change.
- [next] Owner review/merge permission once final-head CI is green; no local blocker.
  See [T18B audit and evidence](T18B_PAYMENT_AUTHORITY_REPORT.md).

## T18A — auth resend expiry contract — `T18A_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- [done] Verified repository ID `1368281478`, exact main `51d0d3755d83b64185066228d98f44ab7bad5e3c`,
  hosted main CI and absence of overlapping auth PRs; preserved unrelated
  platform settings and created `feat/t18a-auth-resend-expiry-contract`.
- [done] Server contract `88096cb7fbea8e3b95f5627ff5a46e8c3d34b462` and client
  integration `47c3a3391e086caf2760b61ee4e2bfacd331cacf` committed/pushed;
  explicit security fixtures `53f9fefdc9d935bb736a37cdcd9f5b0d0479685e` pushed.
- [done] TTL storage/response parity, register/login/forgot-password purpose
  behavior, malformed/failed/offline resend truth, refresh and stale-response
  isolation covered. Review found no actionable security issue.
- [done] Final auth/security 300/300, full Vitest 180 files/4117 tests, browser
  42/42; lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, `git diff --check` passed.
  Browser launch dependency fixed; initial full-suite time budget exhausted,
  extended final full run passed with two workers and no filters.
- [done] New PR #46 OPEN with auto-fix subscription; no merge/deploy. Billing,
  payment UI/behavior, migrations and non-auth Worker diffs zero.
- [next] Final-head hosted CI and human review only; no local blockers.
  See [exact evidence and next action](T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md).
  Do not revisit T17B history or fold in the T18B payment mismatch.

## Current T17B — contract reconciliation — `T17B_COMPLETE` (2026-09-20)

- [done] Rebuilt from exact main `858759f` on
  `feat/t17b-contract-reconciliation`; application HEAD `0f358f2`, certification
  checkpoint `00594eb`; did not modify PR #44 or the old branch.
- [done] Route-owned onboarding screens 04–06 with direct load, refresh,
  Back/Forward, native input semantics, a client-only `today`/`week`/`both`
  planning goal on screen 06 (never sent to `/preferences`; `week` →
  `/week/setup`), unclamped household size (stored `7` round-trips as `7`,
  shown as "5+"), a review of server-stored preferences, and
  server-confirmed completion for authenticated sessions. The existing
  offline-guest path intentionally completes locally. Exactly seven cuisine and
  nine restriction chips are visible, both with `other`; stored values outside
  those chips (including `italian` and `vegetarian`) and independent spicy level
  round-trip unchanged.
- [done] Hardened `/auth/verify` context ownership, shape, expiry truth,
  nullable delivery truth, failed-replacement cleanup, route/cancel/identity
  cleanup, verification-exit loading reset, stale async handling, and credential
  non-persistence while preserving server authority and guest transfer.
- [done] Reconciled the 27-screen registry to reviewer-verified contracts and
  concrete multi-field proof; clean six-width certification **18/18 PASS**.
- [done] Final gates: focused auth **102/102**, verify/onboarding **39/39**,
  full Vitest **180 files/4087**, T13 **60/60**, clean T17 **216 pass/6
  intentional skips**, automated accessibility **12/12 across six viewports**,
  residual **43/43 allowlisted/0 unjustified**, contrast **33/33**, plus
  lint/typecheck/migrations/build/whitespace PASS.
- [done] Added settled OTP and onboarding evidence; clean source and validated
  232-entry/180-PNG ZIP paths and hash are in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.
- [done] Preserved boundaries: zero `src/worker`, protected payment, migration,
  production-infrastructure, staging-deployment, or deployed-production-state
  change. The intended frontend auth/onboarding behavior changes are documented
  above.
- [done] Corrective documentation review and checks passed: whitespace,
  required markers, protected zero-diff boundaries, and full ZIP/manifest/hash
  revalidation. The first ad hoc manifest check used the wrong command-field
  name; the corrected check passed with no artifact defect.
- [done] Restored the repository-owned Preview settings after inference changed
  them, ran the isolated `security-preview.mjs` path at exact remote checkpoint
  `f901b02`, and verified screens 04–06 at 390x844 with supported synthetic
  reset/login. The initial inferred `pnpm dev` path lacked the isolated API and
  guest creation returned 500; the recovered Preview was ready and the verified
  onboarding flow reported no page errors.
- [done] Opened replacement PR #45 against exact main `858759f` from remote
  checkpoint `f901b02`; the auto-fix CI/review loop is enabled. PR #44 remains
  untouched. This publication receipt changes documentation only.
- [done] Final merge-readiness receipt: publication head `1cacd0b` is
  `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`; hosted validate run `35532565549` passed; reviews, review
  comments, conversation comments, and unresolved human feedback are empty.
  The local pass reran focused auth/onboarding/session tests **74/74**,
  changed-file ESLint, typecheck, ZIP integrity/hash, protected-boundary checks,
  and `git diff --check` successfully.
- [done] Post-review fix `56fc01b`: restored screen 06 planning goal
  (`primary-goal` radios, client-only, `week` → `/week/setup`) and removed the
  household-size clamp. Reran focused 87/87, Vitest 180 files/4094, registry
  18/18, full T17 216/6/0, lint/typecheck/migrations/build/diff-check PASS;
  worker/migration/payment diffs 0.
- [limit] `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED AUTH-CONTRACT BLOCKER`: registration returns
  `expiresInMinutes: 10`; resend returns no fresh expiry. The client records
  unknown, and a server/API owner must resolve the contract separately.
- [limit] `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED PAYMENT-AUTHORITY BLOCKER`: frontend/VietQR
  prices are `599000`/`79000`, server payment-intent authority is
  `499000`/`49000`, and the QR amount is frontend-prop-owned. A separately
  authorized payment owner should align all three; T17B made no payment change.
- [next] PR #45 is ready for the authorized user's merge decision when the
  documentation-only readiness checkpoint retains green/CLEAN exact-head
  provider status. Direct board comparison and the NVDA/VoiceOver walkthrough

  repository. No deployment is authorized by T17B.

## Previous T17 — Takosan UI V2 redesign — `T17_PARTIAL` (2026-09-19)

- [done] Baseline gates on live main `769d08597563f816ef9c1dd9523fdafb687de3e2`: lint, typecheck, vitest 178 files / 4046 tests, migration smoke (sqlite3 CLI installed per repo setup), build — all PASS; branch `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2` created; `main` untouched.
- [done] Audit recorded in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_AUDIT.md` (routes, migration map, Frigo leaks, phone wrappers, Week/Planner + settings + notification overlap, fake-flow survey).
- [done] Semantic design system: `--semantic-*` tokens + tailwind `semantic-*` family, kit type/radius/shadow scales, `motion@13.4.0` with reduced-motion provider, shared primitives (Page/PageHeader/Switch/SettingsRow/StatusBadge/UnavailableState/…).
- [done] AppShell V2: bottom nav / 80px rail / 256px sidebar from one navigation model, immersive-only hiding, real links + `aria-current`; legacy `BottomNav` retired with migrated equivalent test.
- [done] Settings IA split (screens 19-26) on real server contracts; inbox/preferences separated; fabricated household invite/join/QR and privacy export/delete fakes replaced with honest unavailable states.
- [done] Planner canonical (flag-gated) with param-preserving Week redirects; onboarding step routes; phone-width emulation removed from 20+ shell pages; fixed CTAs clear the nav/rail/sidebar; Landing/Auth h1 fixes.
- [done] Brand cleanup: zero `emerald-*`, zero user-visible "Frigo Plus"; VietQRModal copy rebranded presentation-only.
- [done] Gates after implementation: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, `pnpm test` 178/4046 PASS, `pnpm check:migrations` PASS, `pnpm build` PASS, T17 Playwright **33/33 PASS** at 390/768/1440.
- [done] PayOS/payment zero application change certified: `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` empty; payment path diff presentation-only.
- [limit] `T17_COMPLETE` not claimed. Remaining: AuthPage (930 lines) decomposition, per-screen motion/semantic-token migration, visual matrix at 360/430/1024 + state classes + canonical screenshots, full a11y pass. Exact list in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`.
- [safety] No merge, deploy, D1/migration, PayOS, Inventory Truth, OCR/AI, recipe-authority, or planning-algorithm change. Production untouched.

### T17 continuation 2 (same day)

- [done] AuthPage decomposed into `features/auth/*` components with mode-presence transition; security semantics byte-compatible (Turnstile single-use tokens, GSI retry/width, DEC-012 deferred transfer, private-session capture); auth suites **11/11 PASS**.
- [done] No-op animation utilities retired (zero `animate-in`/`zoom-in-95`/`slide-in-from-*` remain); overlay/toast/step entrances now use reduced-motion-safe utilities.
- [done] T17 visual suite extended to all six certification widths; canonical screenshots of 17 surfaces captured at 390/768/1440; destructive-dialog focus and empty-inbox honesty asserted.
- [done] Real 360px `/shopping` horizontal overflow found by the matrix and fixed (`min-w-0` on quick-add controls).
- [done] Gates after continuation: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, vitest **178/4046 PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS, T17 Playwright **42/42 PASS** at certified widths (full matrix green).
- [limit] Still `T17_PARTIAL`: per-screen `transition-all`/motion-primitive migration, semantic-token migration of legacy-styled pages (Home/Inventory/Recipes/Week fallbacks/scan/cooking), partial state-class matrix, and human design review of screenshots.
- [safety] Worker/PayOS diff zero; `main` untouched; production untouched.

### T17 continuation 3 (same day)

- [done] All 86 `transition-all` utilities replaced with the scoped `transition-tap` token (explicit property list; zero remain).
- [done] Motion stories: cooking-step directional Slide, inventory AnimatePresence/layout keyed by server identity, scan crossfade verified reduced-motion-safe.
- [done] State-class matrix: bottom sheet, honest offline banner (browser events), 200% text zoom survival added to the T17 suite.
- [done] Real 200% zoom overflow defects found and fixed (nav min-content, Profile/Home truncation, RecipeCard/IngredientRow wrapping, inventory search `min-w-0`); probed clean at 390/360 desktop + mobile emulation.
- [done] Gates: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, vitest 178/4046 PASS, migration smoke PASS, build PASS; T17 matrix green (two test-code defects fixed test-only and re-verified 12/12 at all six widths).
- [limit] Still `T17_PARTIAL`: 856 `slate-*` sites on legacy pages (kit permits `takosan-*` brand aliases), human screenshot review pending, T13 Playwright suite never run in this environment.
- [safety] No product-code change after the full-suite run; worker/PayOS diff zero; production untouched.

### T17 continuation 4 — full-diff code review (same day)

### T17 continuation 5 — release preparation (same day)

- [done] P1: kebab-case Tailwind `semantic` keys — 25/28 semantic utilities were compiling to nothing; guard test added; built-CSS audit 28/28.
- [done] Fresh canonical screenshots at 390/768/1440 inspected; T17 suite 51/51 at those widths; vitest 178/4047; lint/typecheck/build PASS.
- [done] PR opened `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2 → main` with verification evidence; CI hosted tracked.
- [operator] Merge → main CI → staging auto-deploy → manual production dispatch (`DEPLOYMENT.md` §Production gate). Agent does not deploy (rule 19).

- [done] 4b second pass: FoodPreferences no longer flips onboarding client-side; per-nav indicator `layoutId`; dev-OTP autofill is a `<button>`.
- [done] First local T13 Playwright run: 54/60 → **60/60** (logout test target `/profile`→`/me`; presentation test's fake-onboarding shim replaced by the real flow — pre-existing failure confirmed on base).
- [done] Full T17 matrix: 360 16/16; other widths 82 pass + 2 by-design skips; one test-only `networkidle` stall fixed and re-verified 12/12 at all six widths.

- [done] Reviewed all 76 changed files against base `769d085` for routing, tenancy, honesty, a11y, motion and fixed-layer defects.
- [done] Fixed P1: unscoped query keys on new settings pages (tenancy leak risk) → scoped `queryKeys` + invalidate-after-write; offline planning save falsely reporting success → pending-sync state; offline planning read hanging → unavailable state.
- [done] Fixed P2: TopBar hub detection/legacy nav targets; `/scan/*` review workspaces wrongly immersive + ReceiptReview CTA/nav collision; auth label/OTP/reveal/autocomplete a11y; Switch `aria-describedby` + transform thumb; BottomCTA/StickyActions under the mobile nav.
- [done] Fixed P3: fabricated household status badge; inventory row enter/exit motion. Test-only: screenshot spec `networkidle` stall.
- [done] Gates: lint PASS, typecheck PASS, vitest 178/4046 PASS, migrations PASS, build PASS, focused UI/auth 65/65, T17 regressions re-verified 6/6. Worker diff 0.
- [limit] Still `T17_PARTIAL`: 856 `slate-*` sites, human screenshot review, T13 Playwright local run.

## Current T16 follow-up — PWA cache and Google recovery deployed (2026-09-19)

- [done] Confirmed live `/auth` and `/sw.js` were edge-cache hits and production still served fixed cache `takosan-pwa-v2`; repository path mismatch was `/sw.js` registration versus `/service-worker.js` header rule.
- [done] Added release-SHA Service Worker cache/version injection, SHA-qualified registration with bypassed update cache, load/online/foreground checks, prior-release eviction, best-effort one-time navigation of stale open clients after claim, and fetch-lifetime-safe cache writes.
- [done] Corrected effective cache policy: HTML and `/sw.js` no-store; hashed `/assets/*` explicitly unsets the global header and is one-year immutable; manifest retains its intended one-hour policy.
- [done] Hardened Google GIS rendering with a numeric clamped width and an explicit retry-script failure/referrer path; added blocked-script -> successful-retry coverage.
- [done] Extended protected deploy smoke to wait for exact-SHA readiness first, then verify `/auth`, `/sw.js`, hashed-asset cache headers and the exact SHA embedded in `sw.js`.
- [done] Independent release review findings were remediated. Local Wrangler effective-header check passed; two-release Chromium check showed no extra clean-install document request and exactly one update navigation, new controller/cache only.
- [limit] Closed, suspended, or browser-blocked legacy tabs cannot be forced by a deployment; reload/reopen/navigation is the reliable recovery boundary. Awaiting same-client navigation during activation was rejected because it deadlocks the document fetch.
- [done] Gates PASS: focused **116 tests / 3 files**, full **178 files / 4046 tests**, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, production build, shell syntax and diff check.
- [done] PR #42 head `54dd81b...` passed CI `35415335137`, merged as main `6a016f1...`; exact-main CI `35415536459` and staging Deploy `35415763483` passed.
- [done] Protected production Deploy `35415843682` passed on Worker `2f228dc9-d97b-4eb1-8cff-9a0f2df3b51c`, D1 38/0038, recipe `shadow/0/false`.
- [done] Live verification: exact readiness SHA, `/auth` and `/sw.js` no-store, exact SHA embedded in the worker, hashed asset immutable, clean Google popup, exact-SHA controller and sole matching cache.
- [pending] Manual real-inbox OTP receipt only; do not record or expose the OTP value.
- [safety] No migration, D1/R2/customer-data mutation, PayOS/payment change, Canary activation, full D1 cutover, Inventory Truth change or Week change.

## Current T15C-D — production 1% Canary certification — safe stop (2026-09-19)

- [done] Resolved repository ID `1368281478`, fetched exact main `347b536950cf54d25a2d6a880c3c2cb3d8c8f329`, verified clean tree and merged PR #38/#39, and created `codex/t15c-production-canary-1pct` from canonical main.
- [done] Verified exact-main CI `35409762462` and automatic staging Deploy `35409964105`: SUCCESS, staging `static/0/false`, production SKIPPED.
- [done] Fresh baseline PASS: frozen install, recipe seed/import, typecheck, lint, migrations through 0038, build, full Vitest **178 files / 4044 tests**, diff check.
- [done] Public production audit: Worker `6c336889-680d-4cc3-b03b-1007849aa738` / SHA `b41aa468...`; readiness config-valid, DB/queue/email OK; recipe authority receipt `shadow/0/false`; 5/5 lists = 71 and D1-only samples remain 404.
- [blocked] Mandatory operator-owned INCLUDE + EXCLUDE household pair was not supplied. Local Wrangler is unauthenticated, so the fresh direct D1/tail certification and cohort secret provisioning are unavailable. No customer IDs were inspected and no production mutation occurred.
- [status] `T15C_D_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_TEST_HOUSEHOLDS_UNAVAILABLE`; final production remains `shadow/0/false`. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_D_PRODUCTION_1PCT_CANARY_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- [done] Receipt commit `16958c6...` passed CI `35410893001`; PR #40 merged as `763d7e9...`; exact-main CI `35411093064` and automatic staging Deploy `35411300235` passed with `static/0/false` and production skipped.
- [next] Supply both authorized household IDs privately and authenticate the Cloudflare operator session; then repeat D1 certification, provision hashed secrets, prove retained-secret Shadow, run only 1% protected Canary, certify both cohorts/E2E, and rollback to Shadow. No 2%, 5%, full D1, media, or T14G.

## Current T15C-C — authorized canary test cohort mechanism (dormant) — 2026-09-19

- [done] `packages/recipes/src/recipe-canary-cohort.ts` + `src/worker/services/recipe-authority.ts`: server-side override for operator-owned test households — `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT_ENABLED` / `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_INCLUDE` / `RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_EXCLUDE` (Worker secrets; SHA-256 digests of `recipe-catalog-test-cohort:<householdId>`, never raw IDs). Precedence exclude > include > deterministic FNV bucket; disabled by default; canary+cutover only; zero effect in static/shadow/d1 or without a tenant; every malformed/half-applied shape fails closed in canary mode (`CONFIG_RECIPE_CATALOG_TEST_COHORT` fatal; static + loud diagnostic at request time). **R1 remediation:** cohort variables are inert in static/shadow/d1 (rollback = single mode change, no secret cleanup — P1 resolved) and an active cohort requires BOTH an include and an exclude household (`TEST_COHORT_PAIR_REQUIRED` — P2 resolved). Request input cannot reach it. `fnv1a32`/`recipeCanaryBucket`/thresholds unchanged.
- [done] Tests: 25 unit + 4 HTTP (request-control attempts, guest, static/shadow) + workflow/wrangler/manifest guardrail; no migration, no workflow change.
- [status] `T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_READY` — NOT `T15C_CANARY_COMPLETE`. Production still `shadow / 0 / false`; no deploy/config/D1/R2 change. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT.md`. Previous safe stops (T15C-B, `T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`) remain valid history.
- [next] Operator supplies the two authorized households → digests as production secrets → T15C-B 1% canary through the protected workflow (separate authorization).
## Current T15C — production Canary safe stop (authorized cohort unavailable) — 2026-09-18

- [done] Fresh audit on canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e` (resolved by repository ID 1368281478): seed/import/typecheck/lint/check:migrations(0038)/build PASS; full `pnpm test` 176 files / 4008 tests PASS.
- [done] Read-only public production audit: readiness commit == main `b41aa468…`, database ok, 5/5 catalog reads = 71 deterministic, legacy IDs 200, D1-only IDs 404. Latest production Deploy receipt 35404106102 = `shadow / 0 / false` on that exact SHA (helper convergence 2 attempts).
- [stop] No operator-owned inside-1%/outside-1% production test cohort and no Cloudflare credentials in this environment; no customer IDs inspected; no dispatch/approval/D1/R2/config change. Classification `T15C_CANARY_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`. Receipt: `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`.
- [next] Operator provides both authorized cohorts + read-only CF credentials + Environment reviewer; resume at exactly 1% via the protected `deploy.yml`; no widening beyond the 1→2→5 ladder, no `d1`, no media/R2, no T14G.

## Current T16 follow-up — OTP sender and guest account gate release candidate — 2026-09-19

- [done] Reproduced the production email-provider failure through the real Cloudflare Email Service binding: sender `no-reply@frigo.tungjpstore.net` is unauthorized because the subdomain is not onboarded separately.
- [done] Proved the onboarded apex sender path: `no-reply@tungjpstore.net` was accepted by the same binding and returned a provider `messageId`; real OTP inbox receipt remains pending.
- [done] Changed the transactional sender to the onboarded apex and sanitized the known provider error as `sender_not_verified`; no recipient, OTP, subject, or provider exception text is retained in logs.
- [done] Hardened resend: optional KV cooldown failure no longer blocks recovery, failed delivery clears the cooldown best-effort, unexpected failures return `503 OTP_RESEND_UNAVAILABLE`, and the frontend requires a fresh Turnstile token for each resend.
- [done] Added guest account gates: guest `/plus` hides prices and payment UI, presents an explicit login CTA, and preserves `/plus` through a safe local `returnTo`; the guest profile upgrade CTA points to the same auth flow.
- [done] Preserved authenticated Plus behavior and left PayOS, billing, checkout, payment webhooks and settlement untouched.
- [done] Added regression coverage for the apex sender, provider-error sanitization, KV outage, Turnstile token renewal, guest Plus gate, guest profile CTA, and authenticated Plus visibility.
- [done] Application/test checkpoint committed as `31006994849ee9f6d78ae6114f82d77d41efc784`.
- [done] Local gates: focused **86 tests / 4 files**, full `pnpm test` **176 files / 4008 tests**, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build and diff check PASS.
- [done] Browser checks at 390x844 and 1440x1000: guest pricing/payment absent, auth CTA correct, auth accessible to guests, `returnTo=%2Fplus` retained, authenticated prices unchanged.
- [pending] Commit/push, exact-head hosted CI, merge, exact-main CI, and protected production deploy with recipe authority fixed at `shadow/0/false`.
- [pending] After deploy, perform one normal-browser OTP request/resend and confirm actual email receipt without exposing the code. Provider acceptance alone is not delivery certification.
- [safety] No migration, D1 write, recipe authority/canary change, Inventory Truth change, Week change, or production infrastructure redesign.

## Current T16 — production + CSP hotfix deployed; OTP receipt pending — 2026-09-19

- [done] Replaced the landing/auth/onboarding loop with one funnel: guest or account on landing; returning accounts enter the app; new accounts complete three preference-only steps once.
- [done] Added migration `0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`; `/me` and auth responses expose server-authoritative onboarding state; preferences and completion persist in one D1 batch.
- [done] Migrated OTP delivery to structured Cloudflare Email Service with Resend fallback, sanitized errors, honest 503 responses, and production invalidation of undelivered OTPs.
- [done] Unified Google client ID through `/config` and backend audience validation; retained signed-credential-only production auth and added a real GIS reload state.
- [done] Added/updated auth, email, migration, and UI tests. Full gates pass: lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, **174 files / 4002 tests**, seed/import checks, local schema gate through 0038, diff check.
- [done with limits] Browser-sized pass at 390x844 and 1440x900 verified landing, three onboarding steps, offline guest completion, registration query entry, and no horizontal overflow. Local GIS reached Google but loopback origin is not authorized; Vite proxy mutation CSRF cannot represent the deployed same-origin path, while direct Worker and integration checks pass.
- [known audit debt] UX audit remains repo-wide FAIL: repository 19 issues / 686 warnings / 47 passed; `src/web/pages` 6 unrelated existing issues / 303 warnings / 15 passed. No T16 landing/auth/onboarding blocker was reported by the audit.
- [done] PR #34 merged as main `d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`; PR CI `35385363064` and exact-main CI `35385844667` succeeded.
- [done] Production D1 run `35386276549` applied 0038 only; ledger 38/tip 0038, bookmark `000000d3-00000000-000050ea-709daab542439d8e8fab731b65dab714`, FK/quick-check/drift/media/catalog gates passed.
- [done] Production Deploy `35386532369` succeeded on Worker `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb`, exact main SHA, with recipe authority preserved at `shadow/0/false`; rollback Worker is `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`.
- [done] Production browser smoke at mobile/desktop passed landing, Google provider launch, guest session, reload-safe onboarding, preference persistence, cookie security, and responsive width.
- [done] CSP hotfix `79dfca6483d90fcf33380acfe33f880c1e6ff7a5` permits only the observed Google Fonts/GSI and Cloudflare Insights origins; no wildcard or script `unsafe-inline`. Full local gates remain 174 files / 4002 tests plus focused CSP 3/3.
- [done] PR #35 head `c14a3755d95ddae316d5e6636ef85f9784ac4a54` passed CI `35388666150`, merged as `0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`, and exact-main CI `35388963509` passed.
- [done] Production hotfix Deploy `35389274233` succeeded on Worker `e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7`; exact SHA and `shadow/0/false` verified, D1 stayed at 38/0038, and previous Worker `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` remains the rollback reference.
- [done with limit] Independent mobile/desktop verification found no CSP console violations, loaded Google fonts/GSI, one Google frame, no overflow, and 71 Shadow/static recipes. Cloudflare Insights was policy-allowed but unreachable from the verification network.
- [limit] Real OTP receipt is not certified: automated headed/headless Chrome displayed Turnstile but did not yield a token, no forgot-password request was sent, and the existing account prevents using that address as a new-registration proof.
- [next] In a normal user browser, complete Turnstile on Forgot password for the existing account, submit once, and confirm message receipt without sharing or logging the OTP. No code/deploy action is otherwise pending.

## Current T15C-B — merged control plane; safe stop before production Canary — 2026-09-18

- [done] Merged PR #32 with expected head `a7b3d23f2ad8b48203328116d0e35425390d2127` as `a6e81cd89b9e4c6b923cfc39947b01faf44ff5f3`; PR head ancestor and tree delta 0 files.

## Current T15C-A — bounded canary control plane — 2026-09-18

- [done] Re-verified repository `1368281478` / `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`, main `88e8b54d…`, PR #31 exact head and docs-only tree; exact-head CI `35338372250` SUCCESS.
- [done] Merged PR #31 with expected-head guard as `6f589d0201499a3729d343e42ccb6d19fdff217a`; post-merge CI `35340599941` SUCCESS.
- [done] Automatic Deploy `35340976739`: release/staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED; automatic staging policy remained STATIC.
- [done] Closed PR #29 without merge with supersession comment.
- [done] Audited existing runtime canary: deterministic household FNV-1a assignment, readiness-gated D1, static fallback, 30s TTL / 5m stale grace; runtime left unchanged.
- [done] Branch `codex/t15c-canary-control-plane` from certified main; implemented bounded `static|shadow|canary` release policy, 0/1/2/5 choices, derived cutover, immutable manifest fields, and validated Wrangler propagation.
- [done] Focused 121/121; full 173 files / 3995 tests; seed/import/lint/typecheck/check:migrations/build/diff-check PASS. No migration or production action.
- [done] Opened Canary wiring PR #32; implementation/receipt head `44c1e80b…` and later docs checkpoint `642b4f8b…` each passed exact-head CI. The authoritative final head/CI receipt is posted on the PR after the last docs commit because a commit cannot contain its own hash.
- [in review] PR #32 remains OPEN; require the PR receipt to show final exact-head CI SUCCESS and zero unresolved review threads, then stop for independent review. Do not merge or activate canary.

- [done] Live Shadow certification: 5/5 catalog reads served 71, legacy IDs 200, five D1-only IDs 404; tail diagnostics show Shadow/static, D1 500 hydrated, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, readiness `ready`, zero drift/order/hydration errors, zero Shadow errors.
- [done] Durable receipt added at `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15B_SHADOW_CERTIFICATION.md`; rollback Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052` retained and static config rollback documented.
- [stop] Do not enable canary/full D1/cutover, write media/R2, start T14G, alter Inventory Truth/T09/T11, or merge stale PR #29. Classification `T15B_SHADOW_COMPLETE`.

## Previous T15B-PRE checkpoint — STATIC certified; SHADOW wiring PR ready — superseded 2026-09-18

- [done] Re-verified canonical repository `1368281478` / `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`, main `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf`, and PR #29 remained unmerged.
- [done] Re-read immutable migration receipt run `35329772751`: D1 tip 0037, 500 catalog, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, schema gate PASS, FK `[]`, quick check `ok`, media 500 pending/0 ready.
- [done] Static production Deploy `35333517052`: required reviewer approval, production SUCCESS, Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052`, exact SHA convergence PASS, live user-facing count 71 across five repeated checks.
- [done] Rollback evidence retained: previous Worker `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439`; rollback contract is `RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE=static`.
- [ready for review] No approved existing Shadow config path was present. PR #30 adds minimal `static|shadow` workflow/config plumbing and tests; implementation head `97aff50d…` exact CI `35335079345` SUCCESS. Require independent review and final docs-head CI. Do not merge or activate in this task.
- [not started] Shadow activation/certification, canary, full D1, media/R2, T14G. T09/T11 and Inventory Truth unchanged.

## Current T14F — T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE (T14F-A/B/C certified; production untouched)

- [done] T14F-C: 0037 promoted byte-identical (`68e52e6d…`; 0036 `04228788…` unchanged), shipped manifest 500 / 2 batches (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`), `ALL_RECIPES` 71.
- [done] Replay fresh 0001→0037 / 0036→0037 / 0034→…→0037 PASS; D1 readiness READY 500; static/shadow/canary/full-D1 PASS; reader 5 statements, no N+1; user flows incl. Batch B VN/CN/JP/KR/TH/IT PASS; T09/T11 unchanged.
- [done] Closure gates (safe stop `44c0ad38…` resolved): lint, build, full test **171 files / 3913 tests**, typecheck, migration smoke, seed/import checks, diff check — PASS.
- [done] Closure blocker fixed forward-only `8c6080aa…` (tests only): real-D1 suites now recycle workerd before its 1 MiB statement cache overflows on the 0001→0037 replay (cloudflare/workerd#5977). Hosted validate on `44c0ad38…` had failed exactly there.
- [done] Second closure blocker fixed forward-only (test config only): docs-only heads passed 171/3913 on hosted CI but exited 1 on a vitest-worker `onTaskUpdate` birpc timeout starved by long synchronous SqliteD1 suites; `tests/helpers/vitest-event-loop-yield.ts` (setupFiles) yields once per test.
- [done] Hosted exact-final-head validate SUCCESS + `T14F_FINAL_CERTIFIED_HEAD` bound in the PR #25 final certification receipt. PR #25 ready for review, **unmerged**.
- [next] **STOP.** Merge = separate decision after independent review. Production rollout, media population and T14G = separate authorization. Production does not contain 500 recipes.
- [P3] Unpaginated `GET /recipes` ≈ 780 KB at 500 recipes — T14G scope, not release-blocking for development certification.

## Historical T14F — T14F_B_SCALE_BATCH_CERTIFIED

- [done] T14F-A pilot certified at `b0150d0…` (routing fix, 171/3911).
- [done] T14F-B resumed: ingredient preflight + 399-concept matrix committed.
- [done] **399 records authored** (`t14f-scale-399-v1`); factory 399/399 publishable, 0 hard dups, 0 unresolved; QA `ok` 0 findings.
- [done] Deterministic double compile (byte-identical) with hashes; candidate-500 (71+30+399=500) composition verified; shipped 101 manifest + 0036 unchanged; 0037 absent.
- [done] Full gates: seed/import/typecheck/lint/migrations/build/test (171 files / 3911) PASS.
- [next] **T14F-C only under separate authorization**: promote 0037 from the artifact, regenerate shipped 500 manifest, 500-authority certification. Do NOT start here.
- [not started] 0037 promotion, 500 shipped manifest, production/media/T14G. PR #25 draft/unmerged.

- [done] Verified repository ID 1368281478, unchanged main, forward-only branch and inherited
  test-only `8079a37`; PR #25 remains draft/unmerged. Preserved timestamp fix `486409c…`.
- [done] Reproduced 5/7 pre-fix routing failure and strict 71/101 COUNT_DRIFT fallback.
  `2ee6f5cc…` verifies generated legacy release, actual sources/diagnostics, cache and cleanup.
- [done] Routing 8/8, growth 21/21, combined 29/29 twice; non-isolated 29/29; subsystem 383/383.
  Seed/import/typecheck/lint/migration smoke/build/full test/diff PASS: **171 files / 3911 tests**.
- [done] Implementation CI **35223589293 / 105209475052 SUCCESS**. Final exact-head
  [receipt](https://github.com/frigo-4/Frigo-dev/pull/25#issuecomment-5714709031) must bind the
  documentation SHA and hosted SUCCESS before it is accepted as the T14F-B base.
- [done] Pilot 30 / release 101 / static 71 / migrations unchanged; complete 101/order 0..100;
  reader 5/no N+1, imported HTTP flows and inventory regressions PASS.
- [next] **STOP**; await separate T14F-B authorization, using only the final certified SHA.
  Exact commands/hashes and receipt protocol: `recipe-catalog/T14F_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`.
- [not started] Ingredient scale preflight, Batch B 399, 0037, 500 release, media population,
  T14G; no production write/deploy/authority switch. Overall T14F is not complete.

## Historical entries (not current T14F status)

## T14F — WIP safe stop — 2026-09-17 (branch `feat/t14f-recipe-catalog-500`, unpushed→pushed checkpoint; pilot NOT certified)

- [done] Pilot 30 (`t14f-pilot-30-v1`) authored, reviewed, T14E-compiled; `0036` promoted byte-identical;
  manifest 101/1 batch; static 71 unchanged; 0001–0035 untouched.
- [done] Safe-stop verification: typecheck, `check:migrations`, seed check, import check, `git diff --check`
  PASS; handoff `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_WIP_HANDOFF.md`.
- [open, blocker for pilot certification] focused growth suites 20/21: `production forward path
  0034 → 0035 → growth` fails when both growth suites run together, passes alone — fix test isolation
  WITHOUT regenerating data/0036.
- [not done] lint, build, full `pnpm test`, bundle accounting, pilot QA report, Batch B (399), 0037,
  final 500 manifest, PR. Do NOT merge; do NOT start T14G; no production action.

## T14E — merged + main certified — 2026-09-17 (PR #23 → main `f7a55408…`; production untouched; T14F not started)

- [done] PR #23 merged by normal merge (`f7a5540841db27be31cdab9e0c2010cd92bc3861`); `ba1a45d4…` and `7b4edcc8…` in main ancestry;
  tree delta PR head → main = 0; exact-head main validate SUCCESS (run 35182568280 / job 105077715190).
- [done, fresh on exact merge SHA] install, seed check ×3, import check (71/0), typecheck, lint, `migration-smoke=ok` (35, no 0036),
  build, `pnpm test` 169 files / 3889 tests, focused 88, regression 275 + 160, `git diff --check` clean.
- [done] `recipe-catalog/T14E_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`; `T14E_NEXT_HANDOFF.md` finalized (T14F prerequisites, chunking evaluation, release strategy).
- [not done, by design] 0036, real recipe growth, media population, production D1/R2/deploy, authority activation, T14F.
- [next] T14F starts ONLY from `T14E_FINAL_CANONICAL_MAIN` (docs-closure merge SHA). Production 0035 + T14D deploy still
  `PENDING_OPERATOR` per `recipe-catalog/T14CD_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_HANDOFF.md`.

## T14E remediation — 2026-09-17 (P1 nutrition evidence, P2 immutable batch hash, P3 manifest telemetry; PR #23 unmerged)

- [done, local-verified] evidence preserved + persisted as ADR-004 profiles; `canonicalBatchProjection` covers all reviewed metadata;
  `RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID` error classification; `tests/unit/recipe-import-provenance.test.ts` (11); 169 files / 3889 tests.
- [next] independent re-review of PR #23 → merge → `T14E_FINAL_CANONICAL_MAIN` → T14F per `recipe-catalog/T14E_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`.

## T14E — Bulk Recipe Import Factory + Release Manifest — 2026-09-17 (development complete; PR open, NOT merged)

- [done, local-verified] import factory module + CLI + output policy; 71-recipe Catalog Release Manifest committed and checked;
  manifest-driven growth-ready readiness (legacy baseline protected); synthetic expanded-release READY proof; 500/5000 scale.
- [not done — by design] 0036, real recipes, media population, production/Cloudflare action, authority activation, T14F.
- [next] independent review of the T14E PR → merge → freeze `T14E_FINAL_CANONICAL_MAIN` → T14F per `recipe-catalog/T14E_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`.
  Production debt unchanged (operator dispatch pending).

## T14C/T14D OPS — Production D1 Migration workflow — 2026-09-17 (MERGED main 6910a7b4…; production NOT yet mutated)

- [done] PR #21: `production-d1-migrate.yml` (manual, fail-closed, production Environment) + `d1-migration-check.mjs` (+17 tests);
  schema gate reduced to 5 compound terms (D1 limit); docs. Exact-head validate SUCCESS (35168563076). App tree unchanged.
- [done] local rehearsal of the full migration path on a fresh local D1 (0034→0035: 71/71/0, FK [], quick_check ok, drift none, gate PASS).
- [blocked — dispatch] operator must dispatch `Production D1 Migration` (ref 6910a7b4…, pre 0034, 0035, confirm=true) then
  `Deploy` production (ref 6910a7b4…, hardened bb504cce…, confirm_production=true). Inputs: `recipe-catalog/T14CD_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_HANDOFF.md`.
- [not started] shadow/canary/d1 activation; media population; T14E.

## T14D — Recipe Catalog Authority Cutover — 2026-09-16 (MERGED main bb504cce…; T14D_MAIN_CERTIFIED; rollout DEFERRED)

- [done] PR #19 merged (normal merge, head f2831805… in ancestry); main exact-head CI SUCCESS (35157739716);
  local certification 163/3801; receipt `recipe-catalog/T14D_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`; handoff `T14D_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`.
- [deferred — OPS] 0035 production apply, deploy, shadow → canary → d1 progression (config-only, human-controlled).
- [not started] T14E bulk import; media population.

## T14D — Recipe Catalog Authority Cutover — 2026-09-16 (development receipt; PR #19 — merged, see above)

- [done, local-verified] authority snapshot abstraction + static/D1 providers (T14B-B hydration reused); fingerprint +
  strict readiness; modes static|shadow|canary|d1 with cutover fence; deterministic household canary; bounded cache;
  fallbacks + diagnostics; all runtime readers migrated (unknown = 0, guarded); HTTP parity static/d1/canary.
- [not done — by design] production deploy, enabling shadow/canary/d1 in production, T14C 0035 rollout, T14E, media population.
- [next] Independent review → merge → OPS sequence (0035 → deploy static → shadow → canary → d1, config-only).

## T14C — Recipe Media Layer — 2026-09-16 (MERGED to main 3a1e6be6…; production rollout pending operator)

- [done] PR #17 merged (normal merge, head 7b37325f… in ancestry); main exact-head CI SUCCESS
  (35147336385); local certification 161/3776; automatic staging deploy SUCCESS (35147682739).
- [blocked — credentials] production D1 backup + 0035 apply + production deploy + smoke; runbook in
  `recipe-catalog/T14C_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`. Production remains 0034 / Worker 4ed98514….
- [not started] T14C_FINAL_COMPLETION.md, T14C_NEXT_HANDOFF.md (after rollout); media population; T14D; T14E.

## T14C — Recipe Media Layer — 2026-09-16 (development; PR #17 — merged, see above)

- [done, local-verified] 0035 + `recipe_media` schema/invariants/seed; catalog (no N+1) + resolver;
  secure same-origin media route; additive API `media.hero`; frontend resolver on 7 surfaces;
  schema gate/smoke/seed-check extended; 0034 pinned; ADR-025; design doc.
- [not done — by design] media population (71 assets), global prompts (0/12), thumbnail seeding,
  production 0035 apply, deployment. T14D/T14E not started.
- [done, local-verified] independent-review remediation: R2-verified promotion (existence/MIME/size/SHA-256),
  exact SQL storage-key CHECK, `content_length` required for ready; 0035 regenerated (no 0036).
- [next] Independent re-review of PR #17; then rollout: backup → apply 0035 → deploy → populate separately.

## T14B-B — COMPLETE 2026-09-16 (production D1 0034 applied; Worker deployed)

- [done] Cloudflare identity verified (account `ef250a88…0218`, D1 `frigo-db` `f975ec39-…`); ledger 33→34;
  backup exported (SHA-256 `ab082dd4…343c`); `0034` applied; catalog/ordinal/integrity/schema-gate certified.
- [done] GitHub env secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (staging+production), production
  required reviewer, `STAGING_URL`/`PRODUCTION_URL` vars; Deploy runs 35101845374 (staging) and
  35102115354 (production) SUCCESS; Worker `56979cb5-…` serves `4ed98514…`; smoke green.
- [not started] T14C recipe media layer — handoff `recipe-catalog/T14C_HANDOFF.md`; branch
  `feat/t14c-recipe-media-layer` from the frozen `T14C_CANONICAL_BASE_MAIN`. T14D/T14E not started.

## T14B-B — MERGED 2026-09-16; production rollout BLOCKED (existing OPS secret)

- [done] PR #14 merged → main `c7455160bfc8d279d38bc7ca4c0751542012a3c5`; main CI validate SUCCESS
  (run 35072991882); fresh main gates green (157 files / 3704 tests). Receipt:
  `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.
- [blocked-OPS] Apply 0034 to production `frigo-db` (`pnpm wrangler d1 migrations apply frigo-db
  --remote` after ledger read + backup), verify 71/71/385 + integrity; set `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` /
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the GitHub staging/production environments; dispatch Deploy. Auto
  Deploy run 35073197948 failed on the missing staging token (not a code failure).
- [not started] T14C handoff/implementation — only after rollout closes. T14D/T14E not started.

## Historical — T14B-B remediation FINAL (review-ready)

- [done, local-verified] Persisted canonical `runtime_order`; explicit ingredient positions
  (`recipe_runtime_ingredient_order`); hydrator/static catalog order parity; shadow `orderDrift`;
  migration fingerprint manifest (`tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json`, 33/33 pinned from
  `c1c1c14a…`); 0034 re-rendered and adopted (checkpoint `d9130b69…`).
- [done] `recipe-d1-runtime-parity` rewritten on actual `D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog` output (no
  reordering): strict-equal list, recommendation, tie-sensitive ranking, planner tie fixture,
  >5-alternative swap regression + executed swap, shadow health; reversed-catalog negative
  controls; mutation check fails 8/11 with an ID-sorting hydrator (`19b144a5`).
- [done] Docs: category = typed open non-empty string, region = closed vocabulary; ADR-024,
  design doc, handoff, PR #14 body updated.
- [next] Maintainer review + protected merge of PR #14 after fresh exact-head hosted `validate`
  (recorded in the PR body). Do not enable shadow in production; no deploy.
- [not started] T14C media · T14D authority cutover · T14E bulk import.

## T14B-B — D1 catalog parity, runtime view & shadow — 2026-09-16 (READY FOR REVIEW)

- [done] Fresh baseline verified: main `c1c1c14a…`, protected, 33 migrations, 71/59/12, D1 59.
- [done] Goal A: `0034` seeds `gl-01..gl-12` (stable IDs) → D1 complete 71, staticOnly `[]`.
- [done] Goal B: fail-closed `hydrateRuntimeRecipes` → 71 `RuntimeRecipe` strict-equal to static.
- [done] Goal C: `recipe_runtime_fields` (typed category/region, legacy nutrition compat);
  image URL legacy-compat only; steps/tags lossless; provenance legacy/unverified/1.
- [done] Goal D: `compareRuntimeCatalogs` + `RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE=shadow` diagnostics; no d1 mode.
- [done] Goal E: recommendation/planner/regenerate/swap/cooking/snapshot compatibility proved.
- [done] Full gates: lint, typecheck, build, migration smoke, seed check, 157 files / 3697 tests.
- [done] Independent review findings (shadow cost bound, description default, Inventory Truth
  test scope) fixed in `0284a96c`.
- [next] PR #14: exact-head hosted `validate`, maintainer review of ADR-024, protected merge.
- [not started] T14C media · T14D authority cutover · T14E bulk import.

## Current T14 integration refresh — 2026-09-15 UTC

- [done] Canonical main before the final docs-only receipt is
  `a165474a623a8130c9a9ed4f1df096b3ac3b3ae9`, verified in `vn-clo/Frigo-dev`
  (ID `1368281478`). Final tip is recorded in the receipt PR's post-merge comment.
- [done] PR #9 Auth/OCR production merge `911db7f` and PR #10 docs-only
  receipt preserved; deployed Worker recorded as `20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71`.
- [done] PR #9/#10 left recipe architecture and migrations unchanged; this
  integration preserves runtime authority while adding the accepted safety library.
- [done] T14A docs semantically reconciled on current main; fresh frozen install,
  lint, typecheck, test (151 files / 3633 tests), migration smoke, build and diff
  check pass; application diff empty and all 33 migration hashes unchanged.
- [done] T14A exact-head hosted run `35034318031` passed on `e916d292`;
  PR #11 merged normally as `fbd14c771070e1b5594532648d79fb60c891747d`.
- [done] Accepted T14B-A delta from PR #8 reconciled on resulting new main;
  PR #12 exact head `3e393741` passed hosted run `35035112092` and all local
  gates (154 files / 3676 tests), merged as `a165474a` through protected flow.
- [done] All 15 accepted functional paths, PR #9 protected files, 33 migration
  hashes and Inventory Truth authority preserved; renderer leaves tree clean.
- [finalization] Publish this docs-only merge receipt, then record final main /
  `T14B_B_BASE_MAIN` in its post-merge comment. Integration prerequisites ready.
- [done] Preserve Auth/OCR ADR-022; renumber imported recipe ADR to ADR-023
  without changing its accepted architecture.
- [not started] T14B-B. No migration 0034, data parity write or authority switch.
- [deferred] Media to T14C; runtime remains static `ALL_RECIPES` (71/59/12).
- [OPS blocked] Deploy `35035612637`: release success, staging missing-token
  failure, production skipped; main CI `35035415271` passed. Not a T14 regression.
- [historical PR] #4 remains open; recommend CLOSE_ARCHIVE, never merge here.
- Checks and next action: `recipe-catalog/T14_INTEGRATION_REFRESH.md`.

# Historical task boards — superseded as current status

Prior “T14 not started”, production baseline and PR #4 merge recommendations
below are retained historical evidence, not instructions for this integration.

## Auth/OCR production hardening — 2026-09-16

- [done] Remove credential-less Google fallback and keep production sign-in
  bound to a real Google Identity Services credential.
- [done] Make GIS initialization resilient to the async script-load race and
  show an explicit retry/unavailable state.
- [done] Add staged OCR pending UX to upload, fridge review and receipt review
  without changing server status or inventory authority.
- [done] Add auth and scan-processing regression tests; focused `54/54` and
  full `3632/3632` Vitest pass.
- [done] Run lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build and diff check.
- [next] Run browser auth/OCR smoke against the exact PR head, obtain hosted CI
  and review, then decide separately whether a production deploy is authorized.

## Production rollout receipt — COMPLETE

- [done] Production D1 migration applied and verified at `0001`-`0033`.
- [done] Pre-migration SQL export recorded (SHA-256
  `378c023b15c159d140162e6eb74bbf2ad584e7b699c72384379119defe6dec6a`).
- [done] Compatibility Worker `64ee9ed1` deployed before schema cutover.
- [done] Canonical Worker `e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` deployed
  and readiness verified on the production custom domain.
- [done] Remote schema gate, build, lint, typecheck and full Vitest `3630/3630`
  passed; smoke covered health, readiness, recipes, PWA manifest and auth
  boundaries.
- [blocked] PR #4 must receive hosted CI/review and be merged so the deployed
  compatibility bridge is reachable from canonical `main`.

## Canonical consolidation finalization

- [done] Application integration frozen at
  `5f6853d0ed11415871dca0fd31d4981d60518310`.
- [done] Independent remediation completed; `e34ed167` is historical and
  superseded.
- [done] Canonical promotion branch published as
  `canonical/5f6853d-promotion-ci`.
- [done] Main protection enabled: strict `validate`, no force-push or branch
  deletion, admin enforcement; approval count zero under the recorded waiver.
- [done] PR #2 opened against `main`.
- [done] Hosted CI run `34968469709` passed on pre-docs head `c8acd0aa`.
- [done] Final reviewed head `7ede92c...` passed exact PR CI run `34972891435`.
- [done] History-preserving merge commit `a5cfb14cfd5840be23eb16b26a3689f5e2d6e805` created by PR #2.
- [done] Merge tree matches reviewed head; required source lineage is preserved.
- [done] Post-merge main CI run `34973522150` passed.
- [done] Automatic Deploy workflow made no deployment: staging unconfigured,
  production skipped.
- [in progress] Publish this docs-only post-merge receipt through a separate PR.
- [done] Maintainer accepted external technical review for final head `7ede92c...`
  with P0/P1/P2 = 0; native collaborator approval may be waived only for this
  consolidation.
- [done] Production rollout completed through D1 `0033` and canonical Worker
  `e6b9195`; PR #4 compatibility bridge remains a follow-up.
- [not started] T14.

# Historical production integration remediation — 2026-09-15

## Historical canonical-promotion task — superseded as current authority

- Canonical repository plan: `docs/integration/CANONICAL_REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`.
- Production rollout plan (separate): `docs/integration/SAFE_PRODUCTION_MERGER_PLAN.md`.
- Promotion branch: `canonical/5f6853d-promotion` at `f48e830`.
- Archive pointer: `archive/pre-canonical-consolidation` at `d1b06732`.
- PR: `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev#1`, base `main`, head `canonical/5f6853d-promotion`.
- Production frontend/platform branches are represented by later production
  lineage; do not cherry-pick `fafe1cc`, `2052932` or `089c406` again.
- Qwen source `da41686` is not in production `main`; integrate it only after the
  compatibility release, from its frozen source SHA.
- Migration numbering decision: preserve production `0001`-`0023`; map the ten
  certified T08-T13 migrations to `0024`-`0033`; no other collision found.
- Release blocker: old production confirmation writes only `is_confirmed`, but
  canonical `0032` requires matching `review_state`; current integrated code
  also cannot run before the evidence columns exist.
- Next production-rollout task: build/test/review a pre/post-0032 compatibility
  release directly from production `05423f2`. After it is independently merged
  and deployed by an authorized operator, run three independently gated trains:
  Qwen/runtime, T08-T13 plus bridge, then Takosan brand-only. Do not deploy
  `f26003b` as-is; repository promotion is governed separately by the canonical
  consolidation plan.
- Fresh audit: source/ancestry/path/migration hashes reverified; both unsafe
  schema orders reproduced with SQLite; docs-only `git diff --check` PASS.
  Full application gates were not rerun because no code/schema changed.
- Hosted exact-head CI has not reported; branch protection is unavailable to the
  current `WRITE` account. Do not merge until hosted CI and admin protection/
  no-deploy controls are reviewed.
- No merge, deploy, remote D1, production resource or PayOS action authorized.

## Historical candidate remediation — superseded as next-action authority

- Reviewed candidate `e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca` is
  superseded. Remediation commit is `5f6853d` on top of `231d1e7`.
- Qwen production runtime, certified T13 Inventory Truth, hardened Takosan, and
  the additive byte-identical `0024`-`0033` migration bridge are integrated.
- Fixed: protected payment UI restored to production base; real Qwen runtime is
  composed in the queue integration test; truthful missing/0/.11/.9 confidence;
  prior typed runtime error retained; brand tests exclude payment scope.
- Intentional auth difference: certified T13 DEC-012 guest transfer deferral.
- PASS: focused `41/41`; brand `16/16`; full Vitest `3630/3630` (149 files),
  lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, diff check and browser `60/60`.
- Retained failure evidence: affected matrix first ran `300/302`; both failures
  were over-broad brand assertions against the protected payment files.
- Two intermediate typechecks rejected incorrect `fetch` spy annotations; the
  final typed `MockInstance` form passes typecheck and focused `57/57`.
- Access READY: production `ADMIN`, Frigo-dev `WRITE`, both heads unchanged;
  local `origin` is unrelated `Tungjpstore/yaji`, so publish only to an explicit
  verified production target if separately authorized.
- P3-1/P3-2 deliberately preserved. Hosted exact-candidate CI is absent.
- Next: independently review immutable remediation SHA `5f6853d`. Do not
  merge/deploy/apply remote migrations.

# Takosan brand branch board — 2026-09-14 (independent of T13 board below)

- **TAKOSAN BRAND MIGRATION — application checkpoint `e37ee28` published** on
  `hoplite/megara-hyblaia-6b723eb2` from base `897102b`. Not T13 remediation, not
  T14. T13 freeze `32ddbb4` and main `d1b0673` unchanged.
- Done: kit assets installed, PWA icons generated, brand contract, tokens,
  typography, PWA/HTML metadata, SW cache bump, Landing/Onboarding/Auth/chrome/
  empty+success states, copy rename, 9 branding tests. Gates: Vitest 3480/139,
  browser 60/60, QA matrix clean.
- Next: brand review of the checkpoint; on acceptance remove legacy
  `public/frigo/{brand,app-icons,illustrations}`; maintainer decision on domain.
  No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

# Frigo task board

## Active integration work (2026-09-15)

- Production + Qwen runtime + certified T13 + hardened Takosan consolidation:
  **IN PROGRESS** on `integration/t13-takosan-qwen`.
- Fixed base: `05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59`; bridge migration
  range planned as production `0024`-`0033` while preserving production `0023`.
- Current checkpoint: repository/source identity, common ancestry, divergence
  classes, preservation matrix, and migration map recorded under
  `docs/integration/`.
- Next action: integrate Qwen lineage, then resolve T13/Takosan semantically and
  run the local release-candidate matrix. Do not merge/deploy/apply remote D1.
## Current board — T13R certified freeze, 2026-09-14

- **T13 REMEDIATION CERTIFIED — READY FOR INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW #2.** Repo
  `vn-blo/Frigo-dev`, ID 1368281478; branch `hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04`;
  **T13R_APPLICATION_FREEZE `32ddbb4f2bb636fdcf201e9ca99c4689d3655477`** (remote
  == local, verified). Main `d1b06732…` unchanged. Rejected `7b7bb69…` **DO NOT
  RELEASE**.
- Freeze = `7e68e3b` application tree + two test/fixture-only commits (`bd2f5f3`
  fixture collision fix after a 3 failed/51 passed browser run; `32ddbb4` new
  P2-B browser reopen spec, RED at `7b7bb69`). Application/migrations/deps/harness
  config byte-identical to `7e68e3b`.
- Blockers P0/P1/blocking P2 **0/0/0**; AC1–AC14 **all PASS**; roadmap rows all
  **DONE**. Gates (pre-freeze and clean detached): full **3471/138**, T13R-A
  **45/5**, T13R-B **171/7**, real D1 **92/5**, browser **60/60**, 32 migrations
  (0031/0032 unchanged, 0033 absent), fresh + legacy populated real D1 replay,
  schema gate, writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0, diff-check, detached porcelain EMPTY.
  **NO HOSTED CI FOR THE EXACT FREEZE.**
- Next: **INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW #2** of `32ddbb4` and its docs head. No
  merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/reconciliation. Details:
  [T13R_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md).

## Historical board — T13R-A complete, 2026-09-13 (superseded)

- **T13R-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13R-B.** Branch
  `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`;
  application checkpoint `fc0f9c5`; docs head follows. Main `d1b06732…`
  unchanged. Rejected freeze `7b7bb69…` still **DO NOT RELEASE**. This is not a
  final T13 freeze.
- FIXED with red→green permanent tests: P1-1 async evidence, P1-2 canonical
  rename, P1-3 lot-bound draft, P1-4 receipt ownership, P2-A raw evidence
  completeness, P2-B confirmed expiry round-trip. New additive migration
  `0032_scan_evidence_completeness.sql` (32 total; 0031 byte-identical).
- Gates: lint/typecheck/build PASS; **3423/137** full; **45/5** focused T13R-A;
  **92/5** real local D1; **42/42** browser; migration smoke, fresh + legacy
  populated 0031→0032 local D1, schema gate PASS. Writer/reader authority sets
  unchanged from the freeze.
- Next: **T13R-B** — Cloudflare fridge confidence fabrication, inventory
  conflict/refetch UX, Home estimated-expiry qualifier, NULL opened-state truth —
  then a new application freeze and independent recertification. No merge/
  deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/reconciliation.

## Historical board — T13R-A safe stop, 2026-09-13T15:50:34Z (superseded)

- **T13R-A CHECKPOINTED, IMPLEMENTATION NOT STARTED.** Branch
  `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership` at audit commit
  `b9735b4` (also remote on `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886`, verified equal). Main
  `d1b06732…` unchanged. Rejected freeze `7b7bb69…` remains **DO NOT RELEASE**.
- All target findings **NOT STARTED**: P1-1 async evidence, P1-2 canonical rename,
  P1-3 lot-bound draft, P1-4 receipt ownership, P2-A raw evidence completeness,
  P2-B confirmed expiry round-trip. No 0032; 31 migrations unchanged.
- `git diff --check` PASS; no code changed, so typecheck/scoped lint/tests are
  intentionally not run. `.hoplite/settings.json` overlay preserved uncommitted.
- Next: implement T13R-A findings one at a time with red/green regressions per
  [T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md). T13R-B
  blockers (Cloudflare confidence, conflict UX, Home estimates, opened-state
  truth) remain deferred. No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/reconciliation.

## Current board — T13 independent review failed, 2026-09-13

- **T13 BLOCKED — INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW FAILED.** Exact freeze
  `7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d`; reviewed docs head
  `4fcbc96b5a5d4b3cea2c2ad0bdb5682b1866891a`; numeric repo ID 1368281478.
- Fresh gates passed: **3372/132** full, **194/10** focused, **92/5** local D1,
  **36/36** browser, lint/typecheck/build, 31-migration smoke/replay, populated
  legacy upgrade, local schema and diff checks. No hosted exact-freeze results.
- Review found **4 P1 and 6 blocking P2** defects despite those green gates.
  Original AC4/6/10/12 fail; AC9/11 remain partial. R5/R7/R8 and
  U4/U7/U8/U12/U13 are not closed. Do not treat the old DONE table as approval.
- Read [T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md](release/T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md)
  for reproducible findings, evidence boundaries and retained failed probes.
- Next task, not started here: **new T13 remediation branch**, confirmed blockers
  only, new application freeze, independent recertification. Reconciliation,
  merge, deploy, remote D1, PayOS and T14 remain prohibited.
- Application/permanent tests/migrations/harness remain unchanged; this review
  only updates audit/status documents. Earlier board sections are historical.

## Current board — T13 complete, 2026-09-13

- **T13 COMPLETE — STOP for INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW.** Repo
  `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID 1368281478; branch
  `hoplite/mende-26679a14--browser-harness-final-cert`.
- Published/fetched application freeze:
  `7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d`. Separate browser-proven U7 fix:
  `47b10e25d6853a9bc4f9dfcf2e83bc01ba330bf2`. Final checkpoint is docs-only.
- Original **AC1–AC14 PASS**. **R3/R4/R5/R6/R7/R8/R11 and
  U1/U4/U6/U7/U8/U12/U13/U14 DONE**, including both review editors and existing-lot
  metadata edits. Current matrices: [T13 TEST_MATRIX](inventory-truth/t13/TEST_MATRIX.md).
- Pre-freeze and detached full: **3372 tests / 132 files**; browser **36/36** before
  and after freeze at 360/390/430. Focused **194/10**; T08 **130/2**, T09 **1259/17**,
  T10 **98/6**, T11 **39/2**, T12 **22/3**, T13/T13B **271/12**; real D1 **92/5**.
  Static/build/migration/legacy/fresh local replay/schema/diff gates PASS; clean
  detached status EMPTY. Writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0; 31 migrations, unchanged 0031/no 0032.
- Resolved certification interference: first detached browser 35/36 under concurrent
  source-writing tests; unchanged complete browser suite passed 36/36 serially.
  Exact checks/failures: [T13B_FINAL_HARDENING](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_FINAL_HARDENING.md).
- **NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE**. No merge/deploy/remote
  D1/PayOS/T14/reconciliation. Main remains
  `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
- Only next task: **INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW**. All board sections below are
  historical checkpoints, not current blockers or authorization to resume other work.

## Current board — fresh-session Preview safe-stop, 2026-09-13

- **T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED.** Fresh metadata: `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`,
  ID 1368281478; main remains `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` and the
  prior continuation/current fresh-thread start is `a9b5904aeba0fc7e4d649165770a4e86701312a2`.
  The required `2334a6f -> c37a9b8 -> f845d04 -> fd32aa8 -> a9b5904` lineage and empty
  `fd32aa8..a9b5904` non-doc delta were reverified with a clean starting worktree.
- BLOCKED: all three schema-valid managed Preview attempts (`preview`, 120 seconds,
  promotion `preview:3000`) failed before starting `scripts/security-preview.mjs`:
  `Preview port must be a currently discovered HTTP listener owned by the managed preview run`.
  Only browser processes were listening. No settings edit, alternate server, or workaround.
- NOT RUN in this fresh session: flows A–I, 360/390/430 checks, viewport-emulation
  capability, focused/full suite, typecheck, lint, build, D1/migration-replay/schema and
  authority audits. Historical 176/9 and 26 hardening/adoption results are not current
  certification; current full counts are unestablished.
- Fresh checks: migration integrity PASS (31, unchanged 0031, no 0032),
  `git diff --check` PASS. Platform report recorded. Docs-only WIP publication target:
  `hoplite/mende-26679a14`; prior continuation branch preserved.
- NEXT: repair the supported managed Preview interface; resume all mandatory WIP flows,
  then establish the real baseline and complete AC/roadmap, freeze, and certification gates.
  No application freeze/final docs head, merge, deploy, remote D1, PayOS, or T14 work.

## Current board — confirmed UX fixed; browser gate blocked, 2026-09-13 12:40 UTC

- New branch: `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification`, exact f845d04 base.
- Saved/published WIP: `fd32aa8deaee7df454245591015780c59f909352`; old WIP/main preserved.
- Confirmed-review P3: completed wording, real read-only header/controls, no confirm
  CTA/manual addition, working `Xem tủ lạnh` navigation; A/B/A terminal state retained.
- PASS: 176/176 tests in 9 files (26 hardening), typecheck/scoped lint/diff check.
- BLOCKED: one fresh Preview startup reproduced the platform promotion-schema error;
  no supported existing server available. Owner's stop-before-freeze rule applied.
- NOT RUN: browser/mobile flows, actual current full baseline, final AC/roadmap/source
  audits, application freeze, detached full/D1/migration/schema certification, final docs.
- NEXT: unblock Preview, complete all nine flows, measure current full runtime counts
  (not obsolete 3177/124), then follow the freeze/certification gates in the WIP handoff.
- **T13 NOT COMPLETE.** No settings commit, merge, deployment, remote D1 or PayOS change.

## T13B-B continuation — 2026-09-13, BLOCKED_FINAL_VERIFICATION

- Repository transfer verified: `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID 1368281478; exact recovered
  WIP/guarded main/rescue refs and ancestry passed before edits.
- Branch `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-hardening`; published WIP
  `c37a9b8d7afc66507052bbc8f1e8a24fdc896e8d`, not application freeze.
- P1 route/store mismatch and private-session race: fixed. P2 safe fridge domain
  errors/refetch and confirmed-review remount truthfulness: fixed. 23 regressions.
- PASS: final focused 173 tests/9 files; T13B-A backend 1122/17; typecheck, scoped
  lint, operator syntax, diff check. Writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0; 31 unchanged migrations.
- BLOCKER: managed Preview's required promotion argument prevents initial startup.
  Reported platform fault; fresh browser flows and widths remain unverified.
- NEXT: unblock managed Preview, complete all browser/AC/roadmap gates, then create
  application freeze and run clean detached/full/D1/migration/schema/build gates.
  Only afterwards update final T13 documents and create final docs HEAD.
- **T13 NOT COMPLETE.** No main merge, production deploy, remote D1 or PayOS change.
  See `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md` for exact commands/failures/lineage.

## Current authoritative board — T13B-B quota stop, 2026-09-13

- WIP implemented: receipt/fridge full review, truthful evidence/confidence, explicit
  persisted rejection, adoption operator CLI, two truth-presentation fixes and tests.
- Focused combined preflight: **109/109, 6 files PASS**. No final full-suite freeze.
- SAVED: WIP `a8cefd13505bc6b45dd11f45a6323539deb60f93` was published/fetched with
  equality after initial repository-access failures. Public numeric metadata still
  returns 404. Base discrepancy is recorded, not repaired by reset/rebase.
- PENDING: interrupted review, affected browser rerun, original AC/roadmap matrix,
  final authority audits, full/D1/lint/typecheck/build/migration/schema/freeze gates.
- Next: wait for explicit resumption authorization, then reverify identity/base and
  continue from saved WIP. Details: [WIP handoff](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md).

## Current authoritative board — T13B-A / T13B-B split, 2026-09-13

- **T13B-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13B-B**, backend-only. Prior T13 completion
  statements below do not certify the remaining Part B scope.
- Application/test continuation checkpoint:
  `c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c`; branch
  `hoplite/megara-hyblaia-888f1514`; base `3458c6cb971f5d96fce8eda3abc3d708437ce713`.
  Checkpoint pushed/fetched with equality verified; docs follow separately.
- DONE: separate adopted receipt purchase lots; unchanged older lot provenance;
  exact new purchase facts; preserved fridge CORRECT semantics; production
  raw/confirmed correction metadata in the existing command/event fingerprint;
  retained OCR T10 rawName; atomic rollback and concurrent/response-loss replay.
- PASS: focused **1,122/1,122 / 17 files**, real D1 **92/92 / 5 files**, typecheck,
  scoped ESLint, diff/scope/ancestry checks. Four pre-fix negative controls fail as
  expected. Initial event-envelope and race failures were corrected; exact commands
  and iteration failures are in `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_A_HANDOFF.md`.
- Migrations **31**, all unchanged; no 0032. Writer UNKNOWN **0**; canonical
  reader UNKNOWN **0**. Main `d1b0673` unchanged, nothing merged/deployed.
- NEXT: Part B ReceiptReviewPage/ScanResultPage UX, adoption product/operator path,
  final matrix and full verification. **NOT RUN — DEFERRED TO T13B-B FINAL
  VERIFICATION:** full suite/lint/build, dedicated migration smoke/schema/upgrade
  matrix, browser/mobile checks and final certification. Preserve DEC-016 and the
  backend checkpoint; do not rewrite T13 or begin from main.

## Current authoritative board — T13 Receipt/Vision Truth & Inventory UX V2, 2026-09-13

- **T13 COMPLETE on branch `hoplite/lindos-0368e413`; NOT merged to main.** Freeze
  `ad342703fb31a2b97d2798f1161fb83d4d0ed090`; base `578f705`; `origin/main` still `d1b0673`.
- Docs: `docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/` (README, RECEIPT_VISION_TRUTH, UX_V2, AUTHORITY_MAP,
  TEST_MATRIX, CONTINUATION).
- All 14 acceptance criteria covered by permanent tests. Full suite 3,177/124 files; real D1
  81/81; lint/typecheck/build/migrations(31)/schema gate/diff-check PASS from a clean
  detached worktree at the freeze SHA with an empty status.
- Authority unchanged: one writer (T09). One new write statement, to
  `inventory_observations` (evidence). Writer/reader audits UNKNOWN = 0.
- P3 notes from the roadmap audit are now CLOSED: inferred expiry no longer persists as
  `KNOWN`; the Cloudflare provider no longer fabricates confidence/merchant/date/price.
- 7 defects found by browser verification (not by the green suite) are fixed with regression
  tests; see `docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/CONTINUATION.md`.
- OPEN follow-ups retained: `MEAL_PLANNER_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER`; AuthPage raw error text (P3).
- NEW follow-ups: viewport emulation was unavailable in the sandbox, so the 360/390/430
  check is a computed overflow probe rather than a visual check; the reconciliation
  accept (CORRECT/MOVE) path was exercised via tests/API but not via a UI click, because
  seeded preview data yields no actionable verdict.
- Main NOT merged; nothing deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched.

## Current authoritative board — Roadmap reconciliation / gap audit, 2026-09-12

- Audit of RC `64c5501` against the original T08–T12 roadmap COMPLETE: mismatch CONFIRMED;
  **T13 REQUIRED**. Receipt: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_ROADMAP_RECONCILIATION.md`.
- T13 defined (not implemented): `docs/ai/release/T13_PROPOSED_SCOPE.md` — Receipt/Vision
  Truth & Inventory UX V2 (RECEIPT provenance, purchase facts, truthful expiry kind, raw-vs-
  confirmed evidence, observation integration or DEC, UX endpoints, detail/edit/move/
  reconciliation UX, adoption path, error-code UX). 14 acceptance criteria. Starting point =
  this audit's docs HEAD (`ROADMAP_AUDIT_HEAD` in HANDOFF), not main.
- P3 notes for T13 (no release blocker): inferred expiry persisted as `KNOWN`; CF provider
  fabricated defaults; `FINAL_WRITER_MAP` scan changed-payload wording; outbox permanent-409
  head-of-line block (pre-existing).
- Owner decision pending: merge `64c5501` before T13 (release management) vs run T13 on the
  train first. This audit does not authorize either.
- OPEN follow-ups retained: `MEAL_PLANNER_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER`; AuthPage raw error text (P3).
- Main NOT merged; production/staging NOT deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched.

## Current authoritative board — Final re-certification, 2026-09-12

- RC `64c5501` independently re-certified (technical): all gates PASS from a clean
  exact-SHA checkout; no P0/P1/P2. Receipt: `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_RECERTIFICATION.md`.
- NEXT (separate task): ROADMAP RECONCILIATION / GAP AUDIT before any main integration.
- OPEN follow-ups: `MEAL_PLANNER_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER` (before enabling `MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED`
  for adopted households); P3 UX note — AuthPage shows raw `err.message` for generic auth
  errors (pre-existing on main).
- Main NOT merged; production/staging NOT deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched.

## Current authoritative board — Final RC targeted remediation, 2026-09-12

- D3 P1 CLOSED at app freeze `64c5501ab0110658718b3752bd84e537f0854e12` (client
  deferral flow + 7 new tests; server DEC-012 unchanged). D1 P2 CLOSED (main blob of
  `.hoplite/settings.json` restored). D2 P2 DOCUMENTED (SAFE_DEFERRED in T11/T12 maps).
- Clean-checkout gates: 3,092/3,092 (120 files); real D1 70/70; T09 654 / T10 98 /
  T11 39 / T12 22; lint/typecheck/build/migrations(30)/schema/diff-check PASS; status empty.
- FOLLOW-UP (must land before `MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED` is enabled for adopted
  households): **MEAL_PLANNER_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER** — route `loadMealPlanningSnapshot`
  inventory reads through T11 read authority / `fetchHouseholdInventoryFromDb`.
- Next: re-certification of `64c5501` as the release candidate; main NOT merged;
  production/staging NOT deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched.

## Current authoritative board — Final Release Integration Review, 2026-09-12

- Review of RC `d15600186c3e73faba011eb690ac6cd70e8d3d2d` from docs HEAD `5cb4caa`
  complete: **RELEASE CANDIDATE NOT READY** (0 P0, 1 P1, 2 P2). Evidence in
  `docs/ai/release/INVENTORY_TRUTH_RELEASE_CERTIFICATION.md` (+ ANCESTRY, CHANGE_MANIFEST).
- Certified PASS: lineage, main divergence (main still `d1b0673`), task survival,
  architecture invariant, reader/writer audits, migration chain (sqlite + real D1),
  legacy upgrade simulation, clean-checkout gates (3,085/3,085; real D1 70/70; all
  static gates), smoke matrix, concurrency/idempotency/tenancy/fail-closed/cache,
  API compatibility, dependency/config (no change).
- OPEN — D3 (P1): guest→email registration dead-ends with `409
  INVENTORY_TRANSFER_DEFERRED` in the shipped web client. Next: client-only successor
  fix on the T12 branch (explicit “continue without transfer” retry), test, re-run gates.
- OPEN — D1 (P2): restore main blob of `.hoplite/settings.json` on the T12 branch.
- OPEN — D2 (P2): document `meal-planning-snapshot.ts` reader as SAFE_DEFERRED in the
  T11/T12 maps; cut it over to read authority before enabling `MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED`.
- Main NOT merged; production/staging NOT deployed; remote D1 NOT touched; PayOS untouched.

## Current authoritative board — T12 runtime verification, 2026-09-12

- Review findings P1/P2 closed at new freeze `d15600186c3e73faba011eb690ac6cd70e8d3d2d` (`22f675d` superseded):
  real-D1 T12 suite (8), route-level suite (5), explicit STALE_SNAPSHOT race
  classification, adopted-cook replay-first fix.
- 3,085 full/119 files; 70 real D1; all gates PASS from clean exact-SHA checkout.
- No migration; no new writers; PayOS untouched; PR tooling not used.
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Main NOT merged; production NOT deployed; Final
  Release Integration Review NOT started.

## Historical board — first T12 freeze (superseded)

- T12 CLOSED-LOOP COMPLETE at freeze `22f675d1cca76d05c93ebb2ed40bbaea11a72238`: closed-loop suite (9), authority
  maps (UNKNOWN readers/writers = 0), alias tightening. 3,072 full/117 files;
  62 real D1; all gates PASS. **T08–T12 release train COMPLETE.**
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. P3: bounded legacy compatibility for non-adopted
  households (removal conditions documented in FINAL_AUTHORITY_MAP.md).
- Main NOT merged; production NOT deployed; PayOS untouched; no post-T12 task.

## Historical T11 board — read authority hardening (superseded by T12)

- Findings A–F closed (real-D1 proof, adopted-empty, MOVE/DISCARD/FEFO races,
  activeCount, display aliases, freshness fail-closed) → VERIFIED from a clean
  published checkout. New freeze `c15c9a81fc4367b3506a7e2693798ebe1424b0a9`; `657201f` superseded.
- 3,063 full/116 files; 62 real local-D1; all static/30-migration/schema gates PASS.
- No migration; no new writers; PayOS untouched; PR #3 left alone (no PR tooling).
  Main NOT merged; production NOT deployed; T12 NOT STARTED.
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Verdict: **T11 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.**

## Historical T11 board — first freeze (superseded)

- Canonical read authority: REPRODUCED the dual-truth risk (all product reads
  funnelled through the `inventory_items` projection + 1h KV cache) → CUT OVER
  (`fetchHouseholdInventoryFromDb` authority-backed for adopted households; KV
  bypassed; fail-closed; legacy path preserved behind the adoption gate) →
  VERIFIED from a clean published checkout.
- Read consumer audit: production UNKNOWN = 0 (READ_CONSUMER_MAP.md).
- Application freeze: `657201f3a12f18dd96cc96adeac0dd1d3b75e6f4` (PR #3; corrective `4553b8a`).
- 3,041 full/115 files; 51 real local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/30-migration
  smoke/local schema/diff PASS; clean exact-SHA checkout repeats all.
- No migration; PayOS untouched. Main NOT merged; production NOT deployed;
  T12 NOT STARTED.
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Verdict: **T11 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW.**

## Historical T10 board — observation claim fence (superseded)

- Concurrency P1 (competing decisions on one OPEN observation): REPRODUCED (silent zero-row
  UPDATE; trigger-dependent; double commit without trigger) → FIXED (in-batch changes() claim
  guard, atomic loser rollback, `OBSERVATION_VERSION_CONFLICT`, twin replay preserved) →
  VERIFIED from a clean published checkout.
- New application freeze: `7393edcd4fb9cc8bb4df2a06628fb5dc57f8607b`; `4c414fa` superseded.
- 3,024 full/114 files; T10 focused 98/98; T09 focused 323/323; 51 real local-D1;

- No migration; PayOS untouched; no PR created/updated. Main NOT merged; T11 NOT STARTED.
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Verdict: **T10 PASS — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW**.

## Historical T10 board — composition fix 4c414fa (superseded)

- Multi-field composition P1: REPRODUCED (2–3 CORRECT per lot; expiry-only verdict on mixed
  claims) → FIXED (single merged CORRECT + ≤1 MOVE; boundary invariant; T09 atomic compose)
  → VERIFIED from a clean published checkout.
- New application freeze: `4c414fa7eb33329ee12936c0899644af67e48f07`, published/fetched, local == remote.
  Previous `6c28858` superseded.
- 3,009 full/113 files; T10 focused 78/78; 49 real local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/

  Receipt: `inventory-truth/t10/VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical T10 board — initial freeze 6c28858 (superseded)

- T10A source audit: COMPLETE (`inventory-truth/t10/OBSERVATION_SOURCE_MAP.md`).
- T10B domain contracts: COMPLETE (categorical evidence, deterministic identity, pure planner).
- T10C persistence: COMPLETE (additive 0030; evidence never mutates inventory; smoke + schema gate require 0030).
- T10D reconciliation planner: COMPLETE (9 verdicts; exact quantities; no name matching; expiry precedence).
- T10E decision authority: COMPLETE (T09 CORRECT/MOVE composition, one atomic batch, receipt replay, idempotency).
- T10F concurrency/tenancy/corruption matrix: COMPLETE (F1–F5 races, real-D1 trigger battery).
- T10G verification/freeze/handoff: COMPLETE.
- Application freeze: `6c28858acd0627d2d602998107c2e260c5e4f0d5`, published/fetched,
  local == remote == clean-checkout SHA. Full 2,990/112; focused 1,097/19; real D1 49/49;
  lint/typecheck/build/migration/schema/diff PASS from the clean checkout (empty status).
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Verdict: **T10 COMPLETE — READY FOR INDEPENDENT REVIEW**.
- T11: NOT STARTED. T12: NOT STARTED.
- Next: independent review of PR #2. No merge of main, no deploy, no remote D1, no PayOS.
  Full receipt: `inventory-truth/t10/VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical T09 board — FEFO v2 backfill compatibility (train-merged internally; main merge remains human-gated)

- Final FEFO backfill P1: REPRODUCED → FIXED (additive 0029 + executor mapping fix)
  → VERIFIED from a clean published checkout.
- New final application freeze: `bf391c5fdcdd9e9c2f2257db515815e082cb4381`, published/fetched, local == remote.
- 1,237 focused/15 files; 2,926 full/108; 44 real local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/
  29-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS; clean exact-SHA checkout repeats all.
- Native equal-ID FEFO, PATCH, replay, concurrency, adoption and writer-fence
  suites unchanged and PASS. Historical migrations 0023-0028 untouched.
- Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Verdict: **READY FOR FINAL MAIN MERGE REVIEW**.
- Next: external main-merge review. No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T10 by this agent.
  Full receipt: `inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical backfill compatibility board — superseded by bf391c5

- Backfilled manual PATCH P1: REPRODUCED → FIXED → VERIFIED, no migration.
- Final application freeze: `df73bc035c2938b6fd082c57f6bca89a82d8e443`, published/fetched.
- 619 focused/nine files; 2,910 full/107; 42 real local-D1; all static/build/schema
  gates PASS. Exact fetched-source clean checkout repeats full suite and every gate PASS.
- **NOT READY FOR MAIN**: shared v2 FEFO equal-ID SQL restriction remains P1.
- Next: separately authorize FEFO compatibility/schema work. No T10/merge/deploy.
  Full receipt: `inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical PATCH parity board — superseded by df73bc0

- Final targeted PATCH fixes A/storage and B/category: REPRODUCED, FIXED, VERIFIED.
- Published application freeze: `e796f695bdb4228853992cdedc4e3cecf3437adb`.
- Fresh gates: 515 focused/six files; 2,865 full/106; 40 isolated local-D1;
  lint/typecheck/build/28-migration smoke/local schema/diff PASS.
- **NOT READY FOR MAIN**: inherited P1 backfilled-lot PATCH mapping refusal remains.
- Next: separately scoped mapping compatibility authorization, then main review.
  No merge/deployment/remote D1/PayOS/T10 work. Exact evidence:
  `inventory-truth/t09/FINAL_PATCH_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Historical evidence — all prior freeze/readiness claims below are superseded

## T09 F/G/H complete — 2026-09-11

Independent-review follow-up `27427383d61930ea1b67ccbc1d69bb1cc069f931` is published: adopted PATCH retries now replay retained receipt evidence before stale-version rejection; altered reuse conflicts and a new key retains CAS. Fresh full suite: 2,838 tests / 105 files PASS (165.25s); lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build PASS. Next action remains external review; do not start T10.

T09F = COMPLETE; T09G = COMPLETE; T09H = COMPLETE (freeze/evidence, no main merge).
Application freeze `9bf9ac0fe7b5e0d39615f39ae5cc30f84569af2f` published/fetched on **hoplite/kydonia-2785bb72**

local/remote equality PASS. Full gates at this checkpoint: **2,837 tests / 105 files PASS** (155s), including the new 19-test adoption suite, 9-test G concurrency matrix and rewritten 14-test writer-fence suite; 38 isolated real local-D1 tests PASS; lint PASS; typecheck PASS; build PASS; 28-migration smoke PASS; local D1 schema gate PASS (0028 required).
All writers classified in `inventory-truth/t09/WRITER_MAP.md` (no UNKNOWN). DEC-012
intact. Next decision belongs to the external review; do not start T10 from here.

## Historical board — 2026-09-11 (superseded)

Published F safety/preparation checkpoint: `aa43e069edbff7843e9eb7532ff386b27be96a17`.
Pure adoption planner and writer/retry safety are verified, not full F completion.
Fresh PASS: 1,347 focused / 19 files; 2,808 full / 103; lint/typecheck/build;
27-migration replay; 38 actual local-D1 tests; diff/protected-path checks.
Next: atomic adoption receipt/activation authority → functional manual/scan/
shopping/cook adapters → G matrix → H freeze/review. No freeze/readiness claim.

Same T09 task, canonical repository **vn-2d/frigo-dev**. Writable successor
**hoplite/kos-2a686759** directly from interrupted F `66858c5`; previous
continuation `hoplite/orchemenos-e002591e` is read-only. Transfer/ancestry and

## T08 independent branch work — explicitly authorized 2026-09-09

- T08A Audit: complete; dependency map in `inventory-truth/MASTER_CONTEXT.md`.
- T08B–E Domain/persistence/backfill/projection/parity: implemented and locally verified.
- T08F Verification/handoff: COMPLETE. User approved `hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`
  instead of the original feature name (DEC-006); trusted publish/fetch confirmed
  fb00f46 and the docs-only final receipt follows it on the same branch.
- Verified code: `dd2ecc6f7066250dfdc5214a3d6c356e1479b61e`.
- Fresh final-session PASS: 130 focused tests, 1,617 full tests / 89 files,
  lint/typecheck/build, 23-migration replay/local schema and diff checks.
  Prior local D1 apply passed 23/23. Source unchanged since dd2ecc6.
- Remaining T08 work: none; final report `inventory-truth/T08_VERIFICATION.md`.
  Cross-account checkout: `origin/hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`. T09–T12 not started.
- Full checklist/failures/next action: `inventory-truth/TASK_BOARD.md`,
  `inventory-truth/VERIFICATION.md`, `inventory-truth/CURRENT_STATE.md`.

## Independent production/release work (not authorized by T08)

- Production Reconciliation ✅ COMPLETE - post-cutover verified
- Production DB Migration ✅ COMPLETE - `frigo-db` ledger `0001`-`0023`
- Controlled Production Deployment ✅ COMPLETE - Worker SHA `bdb0dda0`
- OCR production recovery (maintenance) ✅ COMPLETE - deployed and verified
- Planner Rollout ⏳

Do not invent T08. OCR recovery is a bounded maintenance candidate, not a new
product task or a production deployment. Planner rollout remains separately
authorized work.
The original release packet did not authorize T08; the separate user-authorized
T08 packet now governs only its isolated branch. Production work remains pending
and must be separately authorized; this branch does not perform or update it.

GitHub source of truth: main.
Deployed application SHA: `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`.
Post-deployment GitHub `main` changes are documentation-only receipt merges; the
OCR candidate is merged and deployed at 100% traffic.
Current `github-frigo/main`: `db2377fd9f63d1be38ce3882c6d8173e0bf9e497`;
the `codex/ocr-production-recovery` branch was merged via PR #17 and its code is
deployed in production.
Release Integration: COMPLETE.
Main Integration: COMPLETE.
PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD: `41d2de6bc76331322cc63e8038432b0b02f60da1`.
APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
Production reconciliation: COMPLETE - schema/code/health/traffic verified.
Production DB migration: COMPLETE - exact ledger `0001` through `0023`.
Production deployment: COMPLETE - version `df7225c9-6f20-4206-9f16-573de6a69c43`.
Planner rollout: NOT STARTED.

## OCR image optimization maintenance (2026-09-13)

- Browser preprocessing candidate: **IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY, NOT DEPLOYED**.
- Scope: in-memory resize cap (2,000 px), JPEG quality 0.82, smaller-output
  guard, cancellation/session fencing and FileReader fallback.
- Evidence: 11/11 focused privacy/image tests pass; sample receipt conversion
  measured 81.9% smaller at unchanged 1,086x1,448 dimensions.
- Gate: run browser/device OCR recall and latency smoke before committing or
  promoting; do not alter PayOS, schema or provider secrets.
OCR recovery status: COMPLETE - DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED.
Next task: monitor OCR quality/latency and schedule the separate React Router upgrade.

## Frozen release evidence

- PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA:
  `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
- Verified application SHA: `0b20061e7dc7405df68b18a18da4166e09494ecd`.
- Verified release head: `0420807968538f61b669569d064c404f67032174`.
- Previous final-head CI: `34405307196 SUCCESS`.
- Previous release deploy workflow: `34396457582 SUCCESS`.
- Full: **1,487 tests / 87 files PASS**; focused: **819 tests / 40 files PASS**.
- D1: **23 / 23 migrations PASS**; upgrade **0020 -> 0023 PASS**.
- Existing rows preserved: **776 rows / 58 tables**.
- Browser: **264 assertions / 36 phases PASS**.
- Payment-adjacent: **82 tests / 7 files PASS**.
- Previous docs-cleanup deploy workflow `34405457796`: packaging completed; staging was not
  provisioned and no staging deploy occurred. The current production cutover was
  completed directly with Wrangler OAuth because GitHub production configuration
  is not provisioned.

## PR #8 metadata and archival branches

PR #8 METADATA: `MERGED`, `isDraft=false`, merged and closed at
`2026-09-09T19:38:59Z`, merge commit `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.
Application integration is complete in main at `23ef51d`; do not merge PR #8 or
kirrha again. Kirrha remains archival documentation-only divergence.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

Local production source checkout is untouched; the production D1 schema was
updated only through the approved additive migrations.

The OCR recovery worktree is separate from the production checkout. It adds the
unapplied candidate migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` locally and
has not changed remote D1, production secrets or Worker traffic.

## Production cutover receipt (2026-09-10)

- Worker readiness: `status=degraded`, `environment=production`, full commit
  `bdb0dda0b1123c4fd940058091e3cb285d5e8eb8`; active version
  `df7225c9-6f20-4206-9f16-573de6a69c43` at 100%.
- Landing/liveness/readiness smoke passed; readiness database/queue/AI/email are
  healthy/configured and only `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` remains as a
  warning.
- Remote D1 exact ledger is `0001`-`0023`; schema gate passes and FK violations are `0`.
- Strict Week reconciliation passes 2/2 plans with 0 orphans and 0 mismatches.
- Preserved counts: users 28, households 28, inventory items 13, recipes 59,
  meal plans 2, scan queue jobs 15, sessions 2 and auth OTPs 0.
- Backup export is retained at
  `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-main-d1b0673-20260910T205627Z.sql` with
  SHA-256 `000c9cb88d6045afb19cca6ce3e1caa308b20ffa214dbb2cddfca0cb78d722eb`.
- CORS allows the exact trusted origin and emits no ACAO for path-bearing,
  localhost or arbitrary origins. No planner flag, PayOS/payment path or secret
  value was changed. The separate T08 `xanthos` branch contains
  application/migration changes and is not part of authoritative `main`.
- Follow-up: test and schedule the React Router `>=7.18.0` upgrade for the two
  moderate production dependency advisories; do not patch it ad hoc in this
  receipt-only cutover.

## OCR production-recovery candidate (2026-09-12)

| Area | Candidate state | Release boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider/model | Qwen `qwen3.7-flash` via DashScope international (`QWEN_BASE_URL`/`QWEN_MODEL`) is primary for vision, receipt OCR, chat and ranking; Groq is disabled unless `GROQ_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`; Cloudflare vision fallback is opt-in via `CLOUDFLARE_VISION_FALLBACK`; DeepSeek requires `DEEPSEEK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` and GLM requires `GLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true` | Deployed at 100%; readiness `ai=configured` |
| Output quality | Zod validation plus rejection of generic/placeholder labels and confidence below `0.6`; empty usable output is `AI_SCAN_NO_USABLE_ITEMS` | OCR remains untrusted draft data and requires review/confirmation |
| Queue failures | Typed permanent `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`/auth/permission/license/schema/invalid-response/quality failures; bounded retries for `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`/`NETWORK_ERROR`/`RATE_LIMITED`/`UPSTREAM_ERROR` | Existing lease, idempotency, tenant fencing, max attempts and DLQ remain authoritative |
| Schema/data | Additive `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`; no backfill or inventory/auth/Week/PayOS change | Local and remote D1 cover `0001`-`0023`; Worker deploy remains pending |
| Verification | Local/hosted gates PASS; live Qwen `qwen3.7-flash` smoke HTTP 200; D1 `0023` applied and gated; Worker version `df7225c9-6f20-4206-9f16-573de6a69c43` readiness HTTP 200 at 100% traffic | Monitor quality/latency; only `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` remains as a warning |

Candidate commits `ec87aec` and `56968ba` were merged through PR #17. Local and
hosted validation, live Qwen smoke, migration, deployment and readiness receipts
are complete; continue monitoring OCR quality and latency.

## Qwen-only runtime / cost governance candidate (2026-09-13)

| Area | Status | Evidence / next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task taxonomy and logical role routing | IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY | `packages/ai/src/model-governance.ts`, `task-runtime.ts`; routing coverage is included in the full 1,606-test gate |
| Qwen-only Worker composition | IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY | scan HTTP, queue and explanation use shared config; production vars set `AI_QWEN_ONLY=true`; legacy adapters are not constructed on this path |
| Budgets, structured validation and escalation | IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY | bounded attempts/calls/tokens, Zod parse, quality gate, repair and model-capability fallback tests pass |
| Cost/usage telemetry | IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY | `AIUsageLedger`, non-PII Worker usage logs, provider usage parsing, and shadow budget reservation |
| Golden fixtures / offline harness | IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY | `tests/fixtures/ai-golden.json`; `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` PASS with no live request |
| Local application checkpoint | `21c442d` | `pnpm check` PASS: 1,606 tests / 95 files, lint/typecheck/migrations/build PASS |
| Dependency audit | FOLLOW-UP REQUIRED | `pnpm audit --prod` reports two moderate `react-router` advisories; test the separate `>=7.18.0` upgrade |
| Production deployment | NOT AUTHORIZED | Do not deploy; obtain review, benchmark and hosted CI evidence first |

The candidate branch is based on canonical main SHA
`05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59`; canonical main and production
remain untouched. Reasoning and judge roles are disabled by default, and the
rolling `qwen3.7-flash` alias is canary-only.

## Qwen candidate recertification and publication checkpoint (2026-09-13)

- Review result: **NO CONCRETE CODE DEFECT FOUND**. Retry ownership is bounded
  by `QwenTaskRuntime`; operation token/call budgets are cumulative; production
  Qwen-only composition fails closed; structured output, quality gates,
  telemetry and Worker AbortSignal handling remain intact. Legacy providers are
  retained only for explicit compatibility paths.
- Focused command: `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/ai-runtime-governance.test.ts tests/unit/ai-router.test.ts tests/unit/qwen-provider.test.ts tests/unit/config-validation.test.ts tests/unit/meal-planning-explanation.test.ts tests/unit/scan-privacy.test.tsx tests/integration/scan-queue-retry-policy.test.ts tests/integration/scan-async-canary.test.ts` - **119 tests / 8 files PASS**.
- Full command: `pnpm check` - **1,606 tests / 95 files PASS**; lint,
  typecheck, migration replay and production build PASS. Remote D1 schema and
  Week parity checks were intentionally skipped without release flags.
- Offline command: `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run` - PASS; six fixture cases,
  no live Alibaba/Qwen request. `git diff --check` - PASS.
- Audit command: `pnpm audit --prod` - FAIL with two pre-existing moderate
  `react-router` advisories, patched upstream at `>=7.18.0`; no dependency
  upgrade is in this candidate.
- Documentation updated in `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`,
  `docs/ai/HANDOFF.md` and `docs/ai/QWEN_RUNTIME.md` to state the pending
  post-unification T08-T12 Inventory Truth recertification and the unchanged
  production boundary. Local `main` remains `f6a48a1`; canonical main remains
  `github-frigo/main` at `05423f2`.
- Publication status: **PUBLISHED FOR REVIEW** to `github-frigo` with a normal
  non-force push; `git ls-remote` verified the published branch SHA matches the
  local candidate, and canonical `main` remains unchanged at `05423f2`.
  GitHub reported the repository relocation notice to `Tungjpstore/Frigo`, but
  the push completed successfully. Next action is code review or a separately
  authorized benchmark. Do not merge, deploy, migrate remotely or alter
  production.

## Qwen pre-unification hardening checkpoint (2026-09-13)

- Application implementation/publication SHA: `f8468eaa7d7fed3cbcf5ac7e780eca07ad3d71e4`;
  remote branch verification passed before this documentation checkpoint.
- Final pre-documentation branch head (including the scheduler-failure
  regression test) is `a145ef5`; this documentation checkpoint follows it.
- **OCR capability:** centralized model capabilities prevent unsupported
  `response_format`/`enable_thinking` on rolling `qwen-vl-ocr`; OCR remains
  prompt-JSON plus application parsing, normalization, Zod and quality gates.
- **Pricing:** Singapore low-context estimates are versioned
  `estimate-2026-09-sg-low-context`; judge pricing is retained only as a
  planning estimate. `estimatedCostUsd` remains non-authoritative.
- **Image guard:** decoded raw base64/data URL payloads are rejected before
  provider calls at 5 MiB defaults (`AI_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` and
  `AI_MAX_OCR_IMAGE_BYTES`, bounded 64 KiB-20 MiB). Remote URLs remain an
  upstream storage/upload responsibility.
- **Shadow lifecycle:** `backgroundExecutor` is optional and Worker HTTP routes
  pass `executionCtx.waitUntil`; queue processing safely skips shadow without an
  executor. Shadow remains off by default and retains budget reservation;
  scheduler invocation failures cannot fail the primary response.
- **Evidence:** focused **134/134 tests across 8 files PASS**; full
  `pnpm check` **1,623 tests / 95 files PASS** with lint/typecheck/migrations/
  build green; offline AI eval and diff check pass. `pnpm audit --prod` still
  reports the two known moderate React Router advisories.
- **Boundary:** canonical `main` and production are unchanged; no live Qwen
  benchmark, deploy, remote migration, secret update, PayOS/payment change or
  T08-T12 import. T08-T12 remains pending U01/U02. After normal publication,
  verify the branch SHA and request review before any release action.
## Historical canonical promotion attempts (superseded by PR #2)

- [historical] PR #1 exact-head hosted CI: GitHub reported no checks and rejected
  workflow dispatch because Actions is disabled for the current user.
- [historical] Main protection/admin review: the earlier CLI identity had push only;
  branch protection endpoint is unavailable (`404`) and no rulesets were
  observed.
- [done] Re-pushed promotion head after an empty, tree-neutral retrigger commit
  `ae1689c1f5525262da3478137b402692e4e4ed45`.
- [resolved] Repository owner `vn-dlo` authenticated, Actions enabled, and main
  protection configured; PR #2 replaced the stale PR #1 attempt.
- [done] Authenticated `gh` as `vn-dlo`; confirmed repository admin/maintain
  permission and enabled main protection with required `validate` status.
- [historical] Exact-head CI remained absent after owner-authored tree-neutral
  trigger `6ec7ff08ef258ef2ca95fb5d24b581b939ef1c92`.
- [done] Owner-visible PR #2 exact-head CI run `34968012294` passed all hosted
  validation steps on `8eb6d2b8d54e5e2fd08c0a11acd9f57a1e068b24`.
- [current gate] PR #2 still needs one independent approving review before merge.

## Auth/OAuth production hardening follow-up (2026-09-16)

- [done] Isolate Safari/Google GIS blank popup to Worker COOP precedence.
- [done] Use `same-origin-allow-popups` for SPA documents and retain
  `same-origin` for `/api/*` responses.
- [done] Add regression coverage; focused `17/17`, lint, typecheck and diff
  check pass.
- [done] Published through PR #9 and deployed Worker version
  `20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` to 100% of the custom domain.
- [done] Post-deploy smoke, health/readiness and SPA/API COOP header checks
  pass. Only the pre-existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning
  remains.
## T18C continuation checkpoint — 2026-09-21

- [done] Authorized renamed repository `1368281478` / `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`;
  exact `b8447e85` base and `2e770f8` handoff verified, existing branch resumed,
  upstream corrected; unrelated workspace settings preserved.
- [done] Fresh fixed-tree matrix: 6 passed; 162 screenshots/strict axe audits,
  zero violations and horizontal overflow. Baseline archive unchanged.
- [done] Owner-supplied approved OS ZIP recovered and checksum-verified;
  see `T18C_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`. Reference unavailability is superseded.
- [in progress] Direct board comparison and source-led presentation findings;
  full T17 regressions, final fixes/evidence/gates/PR remain pending.
- **T18C_PARTIAL**; no merge/deploy/T18D. VoiceOver/NVDA NOT PERFORMED.

# T20 production-readiness track — 2026-09-26 UTC

- [ ] C1 exact-main green baseline: blocked until open, green PR #8 at
  `5b0a6b9` is merged by a maintainer; `main` is `bf57451`, CI `36221190222`
  failed in Vitest. PR #8 local `pnpm check` PASS; not exact-main evidence.
- [x] C2 concurrency semantics: `762015f` pushed; six deterministic stale-read
  tests cover PATCH/regenerate, DELETE, swap, save, Auto apply, valid 404,
  winner state and exactly one revision bump (focused 22/22 PASS).
- [x] C3 cuisine picker runtime: `bc92346` and `c555443` pushed; picker filters,
  stale-page guard and 390/768/1280 browser smoke PASS (focused 19/19 PASS).
- [x] Deep audit P2: `fb4416e` pushed; same-slot substitution safety uses the
  T02 chronological inventory prefix; regression rejects forbidden substitute
  without changing revision (focused 33/33 PASS).
- [x] C4 branch-local code gate: `fb4416e` `pnpm check` PASS (202 files, 4,562
  tests, migrations, build); T19/T20 focused 80/80 PASS. Documentation receipt
  follows in a separate checkpoint. No known unfixed in-scope P0/P1/P2.
- [ ] PR #9 exact-head hosted CI and merge, exact-main CI: PR #9 is stacked on
  PR #8 and CI's pull_request filter is main/master only. Retarget after #8
  merges, then certify; do not bypass or direct-push main.
- [ ] Staging migration 0039 / flag-off deploy / flag-on smoke: STOP SAFE until
  authorized staging access proves target identity and ledger. Local Cloudflare
  credentials absent; GitHub staging secrets cannot be listed (403). No remote
  migration/deploy/enablement occurred. Production mutation not authorized.
# Runtime Ingredient Model V2 — active review candidate (2026-09-27)

- [x] Certify PR #11 merge on exact main `8687ff9`: hosted CI `36269257668`
  SUCCESS, 204 files / 4,597 tests, migration smoke and build.
- [ ] Certify staging 0039: reviewed workflow `36269963768` failed before D1
  identity/ledger on Cloudflare authentication error 10000. Apply step skipped;
  no bookmark or remote schema proof. Fix the staging Environment credential
  through authorized controls, then retry the reviewed workflow; no ad-hoc SQL.
- [ ] Production OOB and media/R2 snapshots: not started because exact remote
  identity/credentials are unavailable. Read-only only after proof.
- [x] Create `codex/runtime-ingredient-model-v2` from certified main; map V1
  consumers, add ADR-033, separate V2 quantity channels and fail-closed V1
  projection/ingredient-promotion helpers. No live cutover or DB migration.
- [x] Deterministic audit/queues: 6,766 rows; 2,860 excluded review-required
  and 169 already-projected conversion-review rows; zero newly certified
  transformations. Source hash pinned and package unchanged.
- [x] Full local regression PASS after audit hardening (`pnpm check`, 206 files /
  4,615 tests; focused 3 files / 35 tests; source/import/audit checks,
  typecheck, lint, migration smoke and build).
- [x] Focused PR #12 opened and hosted implementation-head CI `36271741260`
  SUCCESS on `e321122` (206 files / 4,615 tests, smoke and build).
- [ ] Push final documentation receipt and require its exact-head CI. Release
  gate remains expected-red; no 0040/final
  manifest/T20 enablement.

# T21R-B offline semantic snapshot — 2026-10-01

- [x] Pin certified V1 target release/fingerprint and recompose approved batches.
- [x] Build offline ingredient multiset comparator with strict bridge, malformed,
  duplicate and position-unknown handling; 8/8 focused tests PASS.
- [x] Validate against local 0038 replay: 500 recipes / 2,702 exact ingredient
  tuples / zero unmatched; full controlled Vitest 4,898/4,898 PASS.
- [ ] Review and integrate the comparator into a protected runner-local read
  workflow with an explicit consistency/provenance receipt. Current five SELECTs
  are not transactionally pinned; existing aggregate artifacts lack raw rows.
- [ ] Obtain exact-main CI and production Environment approval before any new
  read-only production dispatch. No dispatch or repair is authorized here.
- [ ] T21G design remains blocked on individual row evidence, T20 impact,
  bounded blast radius and isolated rehearsal; 0039/deploy stay stopped.

Implementation checkpoint: `5dd9990` on
`codex/t21rb-offline-semantic-snapshot`, based on T21R-A `6bcef891`.

# T21R-B protected diagnostic integration — 2026-10-02 JST

- [x] Integrate the offline certified-V1 ingredient comparator into the existing
  manual, production-Environment-gated read-only diagnostic workflow.
- [x] Reobserve all five catalog SELECT results, require equal ordered result
  arrays and three matching 0038-prefix ledgers; label only
  `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC`.
- [x] Bind repository/D1/candidate/V1-manifest identity, prior diagnostic and
  order-coverage evidence; upload allowlisted counts/flags only after the final
  exact-main check. Raw rows and content digests are not uploaded.
- [x] Fail closed on invalid raw optional bits, contradictory comparator flags,
  incomplete captures, capture drift and inconsistent coverage. Focused 23/23,
  first controlled full Vitest 4,906/4,906, lint, typecheck, migration smoke,
  build and syntax checks PASS. Implementation checkpoint: `90569fa`.
- [ ] Obtain independent review, protected merge and exact-main CI before an
  operator-approved read-only production Environment dispatch. No dispatch in
  this task and no V1-relative production count yet.
- [ ] T21G remains blocked pending individual row evidence, T20 impact, bounded
  blast radius and isolated rehearsal. 0039 and production deploy remain stopped.

---

# T21R-B protected integration merge — 2026-10-02 JST

- [x] Publish and independently review PR #33 at exact head `0b28b48`;
  hosted `validate` run `36931130799` SUCCESS.
- [x] Merge through protected main as `483e054`; exact-main `validate` run
  `36931887016` SUCCESS. See
  `recipe-catalog/T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`.
- [ ] No production diagnostic dispatch yet. A separate operator decision must
  select an exact current-main SHA and approve the manual read-only workflow.
- [ ] Review sanitized V1 counts, unresolved rows and T20 impact before a
  protected row-evidence path or T21G design. `T21G_NOT_READY`; repair, 0039
  and production deploy remain stopped.
