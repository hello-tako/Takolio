# T26 response uncertainty and bounded search - 2026-10-15

A browser timeout does not establish whether the server committed a plan. An
explicit retry with unchanged family choices uses the same create key; a changed
draft receives another key. An uncertain family-profile save must be read back
and matched before generation continues. Concurrent conflicting content requires
reload. Keys are currently retained for the mounted setup; current-plan access
is the recovery route after navigation/reload.

Family search has both selected-component and actual generated-candidate work
bounds. Reaching a bound produces truthful limited/incomplete diagnostics; it
never relaxes restrictions or invents stock. Locked components remain subject to
safety validation even after generated search work exhausts. Reused evaluations
belong to exact projected stock, slot, servings and family eligibility inputs.

---
# T24 unknown demand and selected purchase amounts - 2026-10-14

Required demand and selected buying amount are different facts. A household member
can choose half a pack or one bunch without asserting its mass, recipe coverage or
stock ownership. Manual duplicate entries do not satisfy an unknown requirement.

Reviews bind the persisted shared trip, not a member's private planner. Exact source
content determines pending/purchased/skipped state; revision and purchase witnesses
prevent stale edits. Unchanged re-sharing retains decisions, changed revision/dates/
attribution requests review again. Skip/reopen stay reversible and source-linked;
purchased state needs a live linked override. Bought history remains separate.

Immutable command receipts resolve lost responses without another purchase write.
Cached reads do not authorize an offline resolution or a queued-success claim.
Neither a review, shopping checkbox nor materialization writes physical inventory.

---

# T23 quantities and intentional manual meals - 2026-10-14

A manual calendar is an intentional empty plan, not a failed or discarded auto
search. Its slot dates, types, serving counts and manual mode persist independently
of chosen dishes. Manual identities are locked; optional completion fills the
chosen meal structure without silently replacing those identities. A selected
locked main already classified `complete_meal` chooses a one-dish slot template;
this is a structure decision, never nutritional or allergy certification.

Ingredient fit means amount at the destination servings and chronological stock
remaining after earlier components/slots. A title match is not sufficient.
Required, covered and missing amounts use exact compatible units; unknown mass or
package contents stay unknown. No-buy/cook-now validation includes affected later
choices. Planning, materializing shopping and checking purchases never deduct stock.

Calendar/display/projection order must agree at equal instants: numeric sequence,
then stable slot identity. A plan revision authorizes only calculations loaded at
that same revision. Future recipe destinations use the plan's offset and actual
scheduled instant, not the device's calendar date alone.

A measured inventory quantity belongs to its selected unit and opened draft
revision. Pure compatible conversion preserves amount; explicit correction changes
amount. Metadata-only edits omit quantity. Cooking command attempts freeze both
servings and deductions across uncertain responses and offline replay.

Shopping demand remains separate from purchase edits. Success ends a request key;
uncertain delivery retains it. Rows with unknown demand still lack a dedicated
purchase/resolve/dismiss contract, so manual entries do not falsely resolve them.
Coarse regional metadata, leftovers, shared prep and vendor allocation remain
explicit data/product limitations.

An elapsed meal does not reserve current physical stock again. Future compositions
remain editable under the target slot's server time and revision. Shared shopping
uses a trusted current stock projection for future demand, while truthful stale
reasons remain visible; profile/catalog changes still block continuation. The
shopping date horizon uses the saved plan offset, consistently with slot eligibility.

---

# T22 family meal, profile and shopping semantics - 2026-10-13

A family meal is a collection of components, rather than only its V1 anchor.
Default lunch/dinner includes main, vegetable/side, soup and staple; an explicit
quick style uses main/vegetable/staple. Breakfast and one-pot use their own main
eligibility. Completeness means these roles are present and resolvable; it does
not certify clinical nutrition, authenticity or unknown safety metadata.

FamilyPreferences is member-scoped and revisioned: household size, regions,
preferred cuisines, international meals per week, style, cooking days/meal types,
soft desired time and shopping cadence. An explicit save updates the existing
T03 soft preferences. Hard allergens/forbidden ingredients hydrate from T03 and
survive saves unless explicitly changed. Household hard policies still apply.
Regions are soft preferences from catalog metadata; common Vietnamese dishes and
rice may repeat. International generated mains require an explicit cuisine choice
and calendar seven-day allowance. Manual locked choices remain visible separately.

Whole-meal hard time uses conservative summed known prep/cook durations and
rejects missing time data; desired time is a soft preference with truthful
warnings. Locks preserve component identities and serving changes cannot silently
rescale locked selections. Every generated/replanned slot uses sequential stock
projection, without modifying physical inventory.

Saved recipes are private canonical recipe identities with CAS revisions and
unsaved tombstones. The active recipe authority determines availability and picker
roles; an unavailable saved entry can still be removed. Saving never inserts or
authors a global recipe. Session changes fence browser writes and cached results.

Shared shopping is a purchase checklist independent from projected demand. Only
compatible exact units aggregate; unknown quantities remain unresolved and never
become a fabricated one. Sources retain selected dishes/dates/component identities.
Updating demand preserves manual rows, checked state and explicit purchase edits.
Deleting a generated row dismisses it for subsequent updates of that same plan.
Command replay returns its original receipt without recomputing or duplicating
rows. Checking bought and cannot-buy presentation do not import or consume stock.

---

# UI10 Week view and completion semantics (ADR-053)

Week setup contains meal preset, budget, one to three priorities and shopping
frequency. Unsupported day-schedule inputs are removed because they never reached
the existing generation command. Null means unlimited budget; only undefined uses
the 750000 default. Setup and settings use the existing in-memory session draft;
settings does not save preferences durably or modify the current plan. Document
reload resets the draft. Stage, meal-tab and shopping-filter/mode state is ephemeral.

Availability, utilization, budget and waste are plan projections, not evidence of
stock consumption. Unknown recipe nutrition remains unknown. Generating, reading,
swapping or checking shopping items must not import or consume inventory. Stock
import remains an explicit selected-item command; cooking keeps /cook/:slug.

Week completion pendingSync is an existing service signal passed through the store.
Unlike the durable receipt validated for saved Shopping in UI06, this Week signal
alone does not prove a matching command persisted in the outbox. UI10 conservatively
says the server has not confirmed import; it does not promise durable offline
completion or replay safety. The existing Week queueWrite receipt handling and
repeated optimistic projection need a separate domain packet. UI10 introduces no
new wire DTO, persistence, stock command or server authority.

---

# UI06 planner and shopping view semantics (ADR-049)

A planner remains a projected household plan, not actual stock consumption.
V1/V2 composition, explicit proposal acceptance, revisions, hard constraints and
Week dual-write contracts remain authoritative. Recommendation checkboxes only
mark temporary reminders on the current view; reload resets them. Unknown prices,
partial/unplanned/stale and untracked demand remain explicit in presentation.

Saved ShoppingInput supports existing fields and positive finite decimal amounts;
the form preserves blank as invalid and offers the eight current wire units.
ShoppingSnapshot is a web envelope `{items, source: server|device}`; existing API
facade reads still return arrays. PendingSync proves a matching owned command
persisted in the local outbox, not that the server has never committed. A queued
POST/PATCH/DELETE overlays later reads in queue order; same client ID has one row,
queued deletion cannot be resurrected by a stale read, and later edits follow
earlier queued operations for that item. Checking bought does not add inventory.
No DTO on the wire, schema or new stock/domain command is introduced. The form's
uncertain add identity is memory-only; document-exit warning is browser-limited.

---

# UI05 actual-use and completion attempt semantics (ADR-048)

Cooking editable quantities are strings: empty means incomplete,0means not used.
Only finite nonnegative amounts<=100000 and strictly available compatible stock
may confirm. Required-before-optional sequential reservation handles duplicate
ingredient rows and mixed physical units; zero/blank rows peek without consuming.
Projection/remaining values are labelled estimates from the captured stock, not
new server facts. Refresh retains actual-use intent, does not silently clamp it.

The first explicit confirmation captures immutable deduction payload and key.
Sending/uncertain/rejected/restricted/blocked/saved/queued are distinct UI states.
Uncertain retries keep key+payload; known data rejection requires successful
server inventory read before editing/re-keying. Known safety rejection allows an
explicit end-and-select action; auth/idempotency conflicts cannot auto-re-key.
Saved means valid server response; queued means a real durable local outbox entry,
not evidence that the server has never committed. Same/concurrent queued key does
not project use twice. Draft/run ownership and session resets fence late results.
No server/schema/persisted private-draft contract changes.

---

# UI04 review draft semantics (2026-10-10)

Web editable review quantity is number or empty string; empty remains incomplete
and cannot enter accepted confirmation. Positive finite quantity<=10000 and valid
optional date are checked before submit. Rejected persisted lines submit ID and
rejection only, letting existing server evidence hydration retain the original
line. Raw extraction/confidence/price/purchase facts remain separate from edits.

Expiry estimate flags survive synthetic offline commands/projection; unknown
continues UNKNOWN. All-rejected synthetic imports create no operation and report
pendingSync false. PendingSync proves an operation was queued locally, not that
the server did or did not commit (a response can be lost after commit). Matching
in-memory source previews require explicit scan ID binding and ready/confirmed
review state; reset clears image and binding. No durable/schema/canonical mapping
change. See ADR-047 and UI04 evidence; backend normalizer limitations remain.

---

# UI03 discovery presentation contract (ADR-046)

Discovery summaries are read-only projections of the existing recipe authority and
current household inventory. `DiscoveryItem` contains card recipe fields,
matchPercentage (ingredient coverage), canCookWithoutBuying (quantity sufficiency)
and missingRequiredIngredientCount. No ingredient demands, steps, nutrition,
per-lot evidence or safety assurance is carried in list; detail remains authoritative
for those views. Count0 agrees with quantity-based no-buy, never a stored recipe flag.

`DiscoveryPage` includes total/page/pageSize/pages, source server|device, SHA256
snapshot witness and previous/next cursors. Cursor is a current-input equality
witness, not authorization or a retained historical snapshot. User/household,
actual authority source/content fingerprint, stock/versions and filters/page size
bind the witness; changed input409 requires restart. Media may change independently
without changing ranking identity. Shared schema: `packages/recipes/src/discovery-contract.ts`.
No new persistence or inventory/planner/cooking domain command is introduced.

---

# Domain Model — T01 foundation through T05 shopping optimization

T05 introduces `ShoppingContext`, `PurchaseOption`, `PurchaseRequirement`, scoped
`ShoppingBudget` and generated-only `OptimizedShoppingPlan`. Packages are explicit
sourced net contents tied to a canonical ingredient and optional retail identity;
they are not inventory lots. Prices retain currency/source/as-of. Authoritative
money uses integer minor units (BigInt internally; decimal strings in output).
Unknown costs, purchase surplus and dated waste risk remain distinct. See
`SHOPPING_OPTIMIZER.md`; no new tables or legacy shopping/runtime replacement.

T04 introduces `PlanningContext`, `PlanningReference`, `PlannerRequest`,
`WeeklyMealPlan` and native `ProjectedInventoryDelta` contracts. A plan is generated
household/current-user state over an immutable versioned stock snapshot; it is not
a reservation or actual inventory command. Each chosen meal retains T02 demands,
allocations/shortages/variant identity and T03 ranked facts. A branch's projected
stock decreases before later candidate generation. No new persistent identity or
schema replaces existing Week. T05 consumes this output without subtracting initial
inventory again. See `WEEKLY_PLANNER.md` for validated fields and failure semantics.

Period nutrition ranges explicitly concern household totals across requested meals,
with unknown and reviewed/estimated coverage retained. Leftover scheduling is
explicitly disabled until trusted prepared-food storage/expiry policy exists; no
surplus servings or invented shelf life are implied. No grocery purchases are
projected into stock, even when known shortages are permitted.

T03 adds `RankingPreferences`, `RecipeFeedback`, candidate-bound review evidence
and `RankedRecipeCandidate`; see `RANKING_ENGINE.md`. Preferences are explicitly
household defaults or household/current-user snapshots. Personal soft defaults
replace household soft defaults, but all hard policies accumulate. Cooked history
is household-shared; individual tastes/skips/swaps are not implicitly shared.
`RankedRecipeCandidate` wraps unchanged deterministic T02 facts, eligibility,
normalized utility/components/contributions, nutrition and data completeness.
It is not a scheduled meal or consumption instruction. Existing global preferences
and favorites are not silently imported into scoped ranking.

Implemented SQL is `migrations/0019_recipe_domain_foundation.sql` plus append-only
`0020_t01_foundation_hardening.sql`; validated inputs
are `packages/domain/src/foundation.ts` and `packages/recipes/src/foundation.ts`.
These supplement, not replace, existing runtime `CanonicalIngredient`, `InventoryItem`
and `Recipe` DTOs. Do not cast a database row to those camelCase DTOs.

T02's calculation/output contract is documented in `RECIPE_ENGINE.md`; it consumes
these definitions without a schema or runtime catalog cutover. Canonical inventory
availability, repeated requirements, serving scaling, explicit substitutions and
bounded family candidates share one deterministic quantity path.

## Boundaries

| Concept | Identity / ownership | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ingredient | Existing global `ingredients.id` (e.g. `CHICKEN_BREAST`) | Food concept, not brand or stock |
| Purchase Option / Retail identity | T05 server-owned snapshot; optional product/retailer IDs | Explicit canonical mapping, sourced package contents/price/currency; no new SKU/barcode platform |
| Inventory Item | `inventory_items.id`, household FK | A lot owned now, raw label, nullable ingredient FK, quantity/unit, storage, expiry, revision |
| Recipe | Existing global catalog recipe ID | Recognizable dish and base servings with structured lines/steps |
| Recipe Ingredient | Existing line ID + recipe/ingredient FKs | Demand at recipe's base servings; `required_quantity`, `unit`, `is_optional` |
| Recipe Family | `recipe_families.id` | Bounded ingredient slots/choices for a reusable pattern, not every combination as a recipe |
| Nutrition | Source-identified `nutrition_profiles.id` | Basis-specific observations/calculations, linked to ingredient or recipe version |
| User Preference | Existing user/weekly preference tables | Personal/household intent, not nutritional or safety truth |
| Meal Plan | Existing household `meal_plans` plus Week projections | Scheduled choices and projected stock usage, not actual consumption |
| Shopping List | Existing standalone/Week shopping rows | Aggregated unmet demand/purchases, not a canonical ingredient or stock lot |

## Canonical ingredient and localized identity

Canonical ingredient IDs match `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*$`, maximum 100 ASCII characters,
with no surrounding whitespace, NUL, case coercion or translation-derived IDs.
`CanonicalIngredientIdSchema` applies to ingredient definitions, alias targets,
storage guidelines, recipe lines and family options. SQL INSERT/ID-UPDATE guards
enforce the same identity convention; existing 45 seeded/static IDs remain valid.
Importers must map source IDs explicitly, not silently uppercase unknown IDs.
General recipe/family/profile IDs and slugs retain the separate, case-flexible
`CatalogIdSchema` contract (ADR-008).

Existing `name_vi`, `name_en`, category, default unit/shelf-life and icon
remain. New nullable `default_name` and `subcategory` add presentation/category
detail; legacy default name is `name_vi` until explicitly authored.

`ingredient_translations` already has one name per `(ingredient_id, language)`.
`createIngredientDefinition(db, unknown)` validates input and atomically inserts
the ingredient, localized names and aliases. Vi/en legacy columns use supplied
vi/en names or default-name fallback. This is compatibility text, not a claim of
translation. New names accept canonicalized BCP-47 tags (e.g. `vi`, `ja`, `en`,
`pt-br`); language keys are lowercased. `und` denotes undetermined language.

`ingredient_aliases` retains its raw `alias`, plus language and nullable
`normalized_alias`. Indexed key = `(language, normalized_alias)`, unique for
non-NULL normalized keys. New trusted catalog writes use NFKC -> trim -> collapse
Unicode whitespace -> lowercase. Diacritics/punctuation/word boundaries remain;
no transliteration, substring matching, quantity stripping or NLP is performed.
The original alias string is retained (trimmed by validation); source raw OCR
labels remain in existing scan/inventory records.

Names become aliases in their declared languages; the default name becomes `und`.
Explicit aliases make `ức gà`, `thịt ức gà`, `chicken breast`, `鶏むね肉` resolve
to one existing canonical ID. `resolveIngredientAlias` queries exact supplied
locale plus `und`, returning `matched`, `unmapped`, or a sorted `ambiguous` set.
It never prioritizes one conflicting ID. No implicit `ja-jp -> ja` fallback or
all-language search exists; a caller must choose an explicit language policy.
`鶏むね肉 500g` remains unmapped unless explicitly authored; parsing is future work.

Historical aliases are preserved with NULL keys, excluded from the new resolver.
SQL cannot reproduce JavaScript Unicode normalization reliably. T02 must audit,
normalize and collision-review them before promotion. SQL enforces key uniqueness;
application validation enforces that keys/languages are actually normalized.
Direct SQL/import writers must use the same normalization contract.

## Units and arithmetic

`measurement_units` and `UNIT_DEFINITIONS` mirror the existing `StandardUnit` union:

| Units | Dimension | Base / exact factor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| g, kg | mass | g; 1, 1000 |
| ml, l | volume | ml; 1, 1000 |
| piece | count | piece; 1 |
| pack, bunch, slice | contextual | self only; 1 is identity, not a mass estimate |

Use existing `convertUnitStrict` / `tryConvertUnit`. Legacy `convertUnit` has an
incompatible-unit numeric fallback retained for old guarded callers; no new
arithmetic may use it unguarded. SQL catalog units are controlled reference data,
not user-editable conversion definitions.

`areUnitsCompatible` answers quantity-unit compatibility, not package-content
equivalence. `pack -> pack` and `slice -> slice` can count a specified same-size
package/slice context; `piece -> piece` can count the same canonical item. All
return identity quantities, not grams or volume. Use the unit dimension to
distinguish physical conversion from count/contextual identity. A pack or bunch
against 300 g stays unresolved; matching two `pack` labels alone cannot justify
pooling different products/sizes. No product-specific conversion is implemented.

Even `pack -> pack` identity needs compatible product/size context before adding
different retail lots. T01 does not establish that context. An egg, onion, slice
or package never acquires a universal gram equivalent. T05 can model sourced,
ingredient/product-specific net-content or density estimates; unknown conversion
must remain unresolved. Positive recipe demands are finite; available stock may
legitimately be zero. IEEE number/SQLite REAL precision remains existing behavior;
T02/T05 must define rounding at display/purchase boundaries, not round every step.

## Nutrition and safety metadata

`nutrition_profiles` stores `basis_quantity` and `basis_unit` (`g`, `ml`, `piece`,
`serving`), with energy **kcal**, protein/carbohydrate/fat/fiber/sugar **g**, sodium
**mg**. 100 g, 100 ml and 1 piece are examples, not mandatory fixed bases.
At least one nutrient must be known; NULL in SQL/undefined in inputs means unknown,
not zero. No inferred macros or density conversion. Serving has recipe context;
never convert it to mass without explicit data.

Sources: `authoritative`, `imported`, `calculated`, `estimated`, always with a
nonempty reference (dataset/version/record, calculation revision or estimate note).
Source classification records provenance, not externally verified truth. Multiple
profiles may coexist; choosing an applicable trusted source is future policy.
`ingredient_nutrition` links ingredient observations. `recipe_nutrition` belongs
**only to the current recipe version**: `recipe_version == recipes.version`.
0020 rejects mismatched INSERT/UPDATE links and blocks changing the parent version
while links remain, including replacement INSERTs. To revise nutritional inputs,
the catalog author explicitly removes old links, updates the recipe/version,
and links validated profiles in one D1 batch; failure restores the old state.
The DB does not relabel links or recompute nutrition. Profiles remain stored, but
there is no historical recipe-version identity/archive. Readers still select the
correct current version and basis. There is no calculation engine (ADR-009).

`ingredient_tags` distinguishes `allergen` and `dietary`, with a source reference.
`ingredients.allergen_review_state` defaults to `unknown`. An empty tag set is not
proof of absence. Even `reviewed` needs an agreed allergen taxonomy/completeness
scope before hard safety claims; brand cross-contamination remains product-specific.
Missing dietary tags also mean unknown: no meat assertion does not establish
vegetarian suitability. AI/import labels alone cannot establish allergy safety.
`recipe_classifications` contains meal type/dietary/allergen/method/equipment/
suitability tags for querying; tags are descriptive assertions, not a safety
certificate. No current recipes or ingredients are automatically marked safe.

## Storage and expiration

Keep current lot storage `fridge`, `freezer`, `pantry` (room-temperature storage
bucket; not a precise measured temperature). Keep current `expiry_date`, added
date, computed freshness and data source. Add optional `opened_at`, `expiry_kind`
(`unknown`, `best_before`, `use_by`, `estimated`) and `expiry_source` (`unknown`,
`user`, `ocr`, `imported`, `estimated`). Existing lots default to unknown; do not
infer a date's origin from an inventory row's general source.

`ingredient_storage_guidelines` is keyed by ingredient/storage/sealed-or-opened,
with positive shelf-life days and authoritative/imported/estimated source reference.
It is advisory metadata, not an inventory expiration and never permission to
extend use-by. Opening state is unknown if no evidence exists; absence of an
opened timestamp does not prove sealed. Existing API does not read/write new
condition fields; a later endpoint must validate dates and update condition plus
inventory version/event atomically. Do not use direct side writes from clients.

The combined condition input validates calendar dates/ISO-offset opening timestamps
and requires an expiry date for non-unknown evidence. Insert/update SQL triggers
also require a nonempty date before attaching evidence or clearing the date.
SQL does not enforce timestamp syntax on `opened_at` and legacy expiry dates remain
permissive. Local-date boundary rules, storage changes, semantic source/kind policy
and expiry scoring belong to T03/T04, not this migration.

## Canonical recipes and families

Reuse relational `recipes`, `recipe_ingredients`, `recipe_steps`, translations.
Recipe line quantities are at `recipes.servings`, not per serving. Required and
optional lines have positive amounts; absence/availability/missing amounts are
computed, not persisted on recipe lines. Repeated ingredient rows may represent
different preparation stages; T02 aggregates compatible required/optional groups
before serving scaling while preserving source line indices, rather than requiring
a new uniqueness constraint that would delete detail.

New recipe columns: optional family FK and prep minutes; source type (`legacy`,
`curated`, `imported`, `ai_generated`, `user_generated`), source reference, review
state (`unverified`, `reviewed`, `rejected`) and positive integer version. Old rows
are legacy/unverified/version 1. Imported/AI recipes and families require a
nonblank, NUL-free reference (including Unicode-whitespace rejection) in both Zod
and SQL INSERT/UPDATE guards. Internal import/dataset/generation IDs are valid;
a public URL is unnecessary. Legacy/curated/user-generated references may be
omitted/NULL; any supplied reference must satisfy the same text-presence rule.
Source/review remain independent and defaults are unchanged (ADR-010).

`RecipeDefinitionSchema` validates the core demand
and identity block, **not a complete recipe publication payload** (instructions,
images, translations and safety review need separate validation when integrated).
No existing static recipe is force-cast or auto-imported through this schema.

Families have base servings/version/provenance; slots have min/max selections;
options identify canonical ingredients with their own positive quantity/unit at
family base servings. Example: fried rice has fixed rice (1..1), protein (1..1
from chicken/tofu), vegetables (0..2 from carrot/peas). Options do not mean equal
mass or guaranteed allergy-safe substitution. Required slots have min > 0;
optional slots min = 0. A concrete dish may optionally link its family.

Composite FKs bind options to their family/slot; duplicate slot and option IDs are
rejected. Zod validates selection counts against option count. SQL cannot enforce
that cross-row aggregate during staged inserts; authors must validate the complete
family and write all rows in a D1 batch before making it available. T02 now provides
bounded variant generation, selected/omitted-slot traces and explicit deterministic
substitution rules. Missing family instructions/cuisine/times remain unknown for
later publication/integration; the engine does not invent coherent cooking steps.
T01 stores neither every permutation nor a generic rules engine. T02 enforces
candidate/search-work budgets during traversal (ADR-005/012), not after constructing
a Cartesian product. No generated variant is persisted as a canonical recipe.

## Provenance, ownership and deferred fields

Current recipes are a global static catalog. T01 adds **no public catalog-write,
recipe-import or user-recipe endpoint**. `user_generated` describes provenance of
a catalog submission; it does not authorize publication or model private ownership.
T06 must add an explicit household-private draft/publication boundary before
accepting end-user recipes. A source reference must not contain private user data
if it will enter a global catalog. AI/import outputs stay untrusted/unverified.

Cuisine/time/difficulty/servings stay core fields. Meal types, methods, equipment,
family-friendly/quick/high-protein/vegetarian/fridge-rescue labels fit classifications;
derived labels need deterministic rules later. Existing free-form `recipes.tags`
are retained, not silently asserted into normalized classifications. Substitution
edges, retailer products/prices, detailed ingredient metadata, family translations,
nutrition goals, new nutrient registries and private recipe ownership are deferred
until a task needs them. T02 adds only validated per-invocation, reviewed substitution
rules, not a persisted edge registry. No generic JSON metadata bag is introduced.

Input schemas are authoring contracts, not raw-row decoders. Map SQL NULL to
omitted optional fields where required; recipe source references explicitly accept
NULL. SQL protects identities, relations and scalar invariants. Zod additionally
bounds input text/array sizes, canonicalizes BCP-47/alias Unicode and validates
complete-family option counts; those require validated importers plus atomic
writes, not unrestricted SQL imports. Legacy date syntax remains as noted above.

## Migration constraints and rollout

0019 adds ten tables, nullable/defaulted columns, FK/unique/check constraints,
indexes for aliases, ingredient-to-recipes/families, classifications, family recipes
and active household expiry. Insert/update triggers validate future recipe
servings/time/difficulty and line quantity/unit/optional flags without rebuilding
historical tables. Existing malformed rows are not silently fixed; ordinary writes
to guarded fields must satisfy the new invariant. T02 audits old rows before import.

0020 adds ten guards for canonical identity, current-version nutrition and traceable
recipe/family provenance. It checks existing rows first using named preflight
constraints, then removes the transient guard table. Invalid IDs, nutrition-version
mismatches or missing/blank/NUL source evidence abort the ledger transaction before
any lasting schema change. The catalog/D1 owner must review affected rows and supply
authentic mapping/evidence before retrying; no automatic rename, backfill or delete.

Migrations are applied **once via ledger**, not idempotently re-executed. 0001–0019
remain unchanged because 0019 was published and applied locally before hardening.
`pnpm check:migrations` covers full replay; integration tests cover populated 0019
upgrade, preflight rollback and real SQL rejection. The schema gate requires 0019,
0020 and all ten hardening triggers for releases containing this code. Release/D1
owners must apply pending migrations to the target database before deployment;
the remote release gate is read-only. No production migration ran in T01.

Prefer application rollback with additive schema retained after compatibility
review. The existing release gate rejects an older release's shorter migration
ledger, so rollback is operator-reviewed, not an automatic redeploy of an old SHA.
If schema rollback is necessary, use an approved backup restore; never drop new
tables/triggers or delete data blindly (`DEPLOYMENT.md`).
